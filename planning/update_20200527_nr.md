SBKS:
- At Mai's request, BRAT visual config file temporarily disabled so that Kevin or I could help make a figure for the upcoming abstract (Due June 5). 

- Backup script written for the BRAT instance on brat.synbioks.org. Currently, it backs up to Anubis. I can also have it backup to an HPC. Do any of them have tape backups? (Actually, 
this may be more tricky than I thought because Anubis would have to be on the VPN).  

    - **TODO setup a cron job for this.**

ISSUES:
- Computer went down again after Windows updated itself and left 900MB of storage, which crippled the machine. 

    - I installed Ubuntu 20 LTS onto a new, larger hard drive.
    as well as PyCharm and the Ramsvpn. 
    - I copied all projects and data, and installed MTT, InferNER, and Biomedical Datasets.
- Experiments:
    
    - Altered `train.py` and configs to do train on dev, then do a final round of 
    evaluation on the test set. 
    - **TODO**: extend `multi_tasking_bert.predict()` to write out the predictions in the 
    InferNER conll-style format so that it will work with your scripts.
