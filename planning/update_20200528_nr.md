## SBKS 

Old
- Backup script written for the BRAT instance on brat.synbioks.org. Currently, it backs up to Anubis. I can also have it backup to an HPC. Do any of them have tape backups? (Actually, 
this may be more tricky than I thought because Anubis would have to be on the VPN).  

    - **TODO setup a cron job for this.**

## Data

- Backed up data and project files onto the Drive, and an external drive (local).
    - Code for InferNER is backed up on Github in Synbiobert (**TODO insert link**)

## Experiments:
    
    New 
    
    Old
    - **TODO**: extend `multi_tasking_bert.predict()` to write out the predictions in the 
    InferNER conll-style format so that it will work with your scripts.
