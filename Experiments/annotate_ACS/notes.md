# Notes on ACS dataset annotation using BioBert

## Objective
Previously, 97 documents from the ACS corpus were annotated using BioBERT, 
which had been fine-tuned on labelled NER datasets from the HUNER corpus. 

The goal currently is to annotate all documents in the ACS corpus using the 
same BioBERT NER models.
