[0001] OLIGOMERIC AMIDOAMINES OR AMIDOQUATS FOR FABRIC OR HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/694,966 , filed on 29 June 2005 , which is incorporated herein by reference . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002 ] Biodegradable softeners are described in the prior art . Compositions containing quaternary ammonium salts having at least one long chain hydrocarbyl group are commonly used to provide fabric softening benefits when used in a laundry rinse operation . [0003] Oligomeric esteramines and oligomeric esterquats are compounds commonly described in the prior art to effect fabric softening . These compounds are sensitive to hydrolysis and can degrade over time . Consequently , softening compositions in which these ingredients are present lose some of their ability to soften fabric over time . Correspondingly , clear softening compositions obtained with oligomeric esterquats become turbid or cloudy due to the increased content of fatty acid generated by hydrolysis . [0004 ] Accordingly , there is a need in the art for improving the stability of oligomeric-type amines and quats while retaining their softening efficacy and ability to provide clear or transparent or translucent compositions . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005 ] In one aspect of the invention , provided is an oligomeric amidoamine comprising a reaction product of ( A ) , ( B) , and ( C ) wherein : ( A ) represents an alkylene polyamine having the formula : R<1> N R<2> R<3> wherein R<1> , R<2> , R<3> are independently H or -R<5>-N-( R<4>)2 , wherein not all of R<1> , R<2> , and R<3> are H ; R<4>is H or -R<5>-N-( R<8>)2 ; R<8> is independently H or R<5> ; and R<5> is ( i ) a C1-C23 alkylene or alkenyl group optionally substituted or branched ; or ( ii ) an aryl group ; ( B ) represents a dicarboxylic acid or a reactive derivative of such acid having the formula : HOOC-R<5>-COOH wherein R5 is defined as above ; and ( C ) represents ( i ) a fatty acid having the formula : R<6>-COOH wherein R<6> is a linear or branched C6-C23 alkyl or alkenyl group ; and/or ( ii ) an alkyl ester or glyceride of the fatty acid ( i ) .

[0001] Process for the preparation of peroxy acids Field of the invention The invention relates to the preparation of relatively concentrated , storable peroxy acid solutions containing performic acid . The invention also relates to relatively concentrated , storable peroxy acid solutions and to the use of such solutions . Background of the invention Hydrogen peroxide is known as a moderately effective disinfecting agent with some bacteriostatic properties . It is applied in the disinfection of sewage waters etc . The utilization of the reactivity of hydrogen peroxide with metal ions ( Fenton reaction ) is the most powerful use of hydrogen peroxide in disinfection . UV irradiation is another applicable way to activate hydrogen peroxide in disinfection . Both Fenton reaction and UV irradiation produce hydroxyl radicals to the reaction media . However , the disinfection power of hydrogen peroxide is not sufficient for most of the microbes . Peracetic acid ( PAA ) is known as an effective disinfecting agent providing a rapid reduction of bacteria growth for most of the common bacteria . It is applied in the sterilization of the equipment in dairy industry . Moreover , PAA is applied in pulp and paper industry for the control of the microbial growth in process waters . In addition , peracetic acid is applied in the post-bleaching of kraft pulps after delignification and peroxide bleaching steps . Peracetic acid is traditionally prepared via an equilibrium reaction between acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide resulting in an equilibrium solution : acetic acid + hydrogen peroxide < > peracetic acid + water This reaction occurs only when catalyzed by a strong mineral acid , e.g . sulfuric acid . The equilibrium solution of peracetic acid is used as a disinfecting agent for example in process water applications , greenhouses , dairy industry etc . Similar equilibria occur with formic acid and hydrogen peroxide , resulting in solutions containing performic acid ( PFA ) . PFA solutions are proven to be more effective disinfecting agents than peracetic acid solutions . Due to instability and high reactivity of PFA the solutions of PFA are not stable . Thus , PFA solutions have to be prepared in situ . A stable disinfecting agent comparable with PFA should be desirable for applications in greenhouses , industrial and institutional ( I&I ) cleaning and control of microbial growth in process waters e.g . in pulp and paper ( P &P ) industry . In WO 94/20424 performic acid is successfully applied in the control of microbial growth in the horticulture . A dilute performic acid solution fed into the nutrient solution or drain water prevents the growth of algae in the pipelines going to the plants preventing them from plugging . Extensive studies of the applicant have shown that the equilibrium mixtures of PAA are not applicable in such applications due to their lower reactivity towards microbes . Furthermore , the disinfection power of formic acid in the absence of hydrogen peroxide is proven to be negligible compared to peroxy acids . The stability of peroxy acids is known to increase with increasing molecular weight . On the other hand , together with the reactivity , the disinfection power of peroxy acids increases with the decrease of the molecular weight . Performic acid ( PFA ) is known as the most powerful disinfection agent among the peroxy acids . Several studies have shown the effect of performic acid in the control of microbial growth . One of the earlier references is J. Hyg . Epidem . Microbiol . Immunol . ( 1968 ) 12 , 115 . WO 94/20424 describes the preparation of performic acid solutions in situ by reacting formic acid and hydrogen peroxide in a molar ratio of from 1:10 to 10:1 , preferably from 1:1 to 1:5 . The PFA solution can be employed for preventing and combating harmful microorganisms . Typically PFA is used in an amount of 1 -1000 ppm . EP 231632 A discloses the industrial use of performic acid as a sanitizer . The performic acid solution is prepared in situ from an aqueous solution containing from 10 to 50 % by weight hydrogen peroxide and a solution containing from 5 to 100 % by weight formic acid by reacting the same in the presence of a catalyst , the weight ratio of hydrogen peroxide to formic acid being in the range of from 1:6 to 1:1.5 . For greenhouse disinfection purposes , the solution of PFA is prepared by mixing for example , 35 % hydrogen peroxide with 15 % formic acid solution . The resulting solution is then diluted with the nutrient solution and fed to the plants . Due to the fact that performic acid solutions are explosive in higher concentrations , only low concentrations of performic acid solutions can be handled safely . Mixtures of dilute solutions of performic acid and peracetic acid are known from the recent patent literature . US 6 211 237 Bl discloses a dilute disinfecting agent comprising small amounts of performic acid and peracetic acid , the total amount of these peracids typically being less than 4 % by weight . The main component of the agent is hydrogen peroxide , the amount thereof typically being about 50 % by weight . The agent may be used for example for disinfecting swimming pool waters . The dilute solutions of PFA and PAA with hydrogen peroxide are prepared in situ . It is also known for the man skilled in the art that peroxy acid solutions , even the equilibrium solutions of performic acid , are relatively stable at low concentrations , up to 2 % by weight , for several days . US 2004/0035537 describes a method for bleaching pulp with a solution containing peracetic acid and performic acid . Also in this application , dilute peroxy acid solutions are prepared in situ by bringing acetic acid and formic acid into contact with hydrogen peroxide at a concentration greater than 50 % by weight . The ratio of acetic acid + peracetic acid to formic acid + performic acid is preferably 9 to 1 by volume . The amount of peracids in the obtained solution is very low , typically less than 2 % by weight . US 6 284 793 Bl discloses a biocidal agent for treating ballast sea water . The biocidal agent is in the form of a solution containing peracetic acid , performic acid , acetic acid , formic acid , hydrogen peroxide and water and optionally a mineral acid catalyst and active oxygen stabilizers . Such a solution may be obtained by adding formic acid to an equilibrium peracetic acid solution , typically containing 1 to 15 % by weight peracetic acid . According to this document performic acid is more effective compared with peracetic acid , but also more susceptible to decomposition and therefore formic acid is added to the solution containing peracetic acid only just prior to use . When the equilibrium peracetic acid and formic acid are used in combination , the formic acid being added directly to the peracetic acid or simultaneously to the ballast water , the formic acid is used in a quantity of 10 to 1000 % by weight , based on the sum of peracetic acid and acetic acid . In the working examples the formic acid is added to equilibrium peracetic acid in an amount of about 800 % by weight , based on the sum of peracetic acid and acetic acid . Peroxy acid solutions are most commonly prepared via an equilibrium reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the appropriate carboxylic acid . In the case of peracetic acid and carboxylic acids having higher molecular weight , an acid catalysis is required in order to reach the equilibrium in an appropriate period of time . Mineral acids , for example sulphuric acid , hydrochloric acid etc . are commonly applied as acid catalysts in such reactions . In the case of formic acid , an additional acid catalyst is not necessary according to the literature ( Jones , C. W. , " Applications of hydrogen peroxide and derivatives " , Royal Society of Chemistry ; Clean Technology Monographs , 1999 , pp . 61- 77 ) . Description of the invention According to the invention it was surprisingly found that in equilibrium solutions prepared by mixing acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in molar ratios in the range from 0.5 : 1 to 8 : 1 ( mol acetic acid / mol hydrogen peroxide ) , acetic acid can be replaced by formic acid in an amount of up to 20 % by weight , and yet provide a storable solution . In the presence of common peroxide stabilizers , such concentrated peroxy acid solutions are stable enough for the storage for several weeks . According to the invention it was found that substantial amounts of formic acid can be introduced without loosing the stability of the resulting peroxy acid solution . Thus , in one aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a solution comprising a first peroxy acid comprising performic acid and a second peroxy acid , said process comprising forming a carboxylic acid solution comprising a first carboxylic acid comprising formic acid , a second carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide , wherein the amount of formic acid is from 0.5 to 20 % by weight of the amount of the second carboxylic acid , and allowing the components to react to form a solution comprising performic acid and said second peroxy acid , the amount of peroxy acids being at least 5 % by weight . The peroxy acid solution can be prepared by pre-mixing the first and second carboxylic acids followed by the addition of a hydrogen peroxide solution . Alternatively , the peroxy acid solution can be prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of the second carboxylic acid , e.g . acetic acid solution , and hydrogen peroxide solution followed by the addition of the first carboxylic acid , i .e . formic acid to the equilibrium mixture . The reaction equilibria are set in 1-2 hour or in a longer period of time , largely depending on the temperature of the reaction mixture . The reaction temperature can be in the limits of 0 <0>C to 80 [deg.]C. Preferably , the reaction temperature should be between 0 [deg.]C and 50 <0>C. Most preferably , the reaction temperature should be between 0[deg. ] and 25 [deg.]C in order to obtain the best stability of the peroxy acid solution . The concentrations of the carboxylic acid solutions applied in the formation of the peroxy acid solution can vary from 30 % to 100 % by weight . Generally , higher concentrations are favorable in order to reach higher final concentrations of the peroxy acids . The concentration of hydrogen peroxide solution used for the formation of peroxy acid solution can be between 10 % and 80 % by weight . The hydrogen peroxide is introduced into the solution as an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution , preferably having a concentration of 10 % to 55 % , more preferably 30 % to 55 % by weight . Generally , higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are favorable in order to reach higher final concentrations of the peroxy acids . However , safety aspects must be taken into consideration in the preparation of concentrated peroxy acid solutions . The principles of the safety aspects concerning the preparation of mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and organic matter is described for example in " Concentrated Hydrogen Peroxide : Summary of Research Data and Safety Limitations " ( Shell Chemical Corp. , Bull . SC 59-44 ) . The reaction time is largely depending on the carboxylic acids used . The kinetics of the formation of peroxyformic acid is described by Mosovsky et .al . in Collect Czech . Chem . Commun . vol 61 , 1996 , pp . 1457-1463 and by O.D. Shapilov and Ua . L. Kostyukovskii in Kinetika Kataliz vol . 15 , n :o 4 , 1974 p . 1065 . The kinetics of the formation of peracetic acid is also well known in the literature . However , the kinetics of the formation of the mixtures of the peroxy acids may be different when mixtures of carboxylic acids are applied . The amount of peroxy acids in the obtained solution is preferably from 5 to 20 % by weight , more preferably from 10 to 20 % by weight . The amount of formic acid is preferably from 2 to 15 % by weight of the amount of the second carboxylic acid . The molar ratio of the carboxylic acids to hydrogen peroxide in the carboxylic acid solution is preferably in the range from 0.5:1 to 8:1 , more preferably from 0.7 :1 to 2:1. Said molar ratio may also be in the range from 2:1 to 8:1. The obtained solution is preferably an equilibrium solution additionally comprising formic acid , the second carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide . The amount of formic acid and performic acid in the equilibrium solution is preferably from 2 to 20 % by weight . Said second carboxylic acid is preferably an aliphatic C2-C18 carboxylic acid including acetic acid , propionic acid , phtalic acid , oxalic acid , malic acid , maleic acid and fumaric acid and mixtures thereof , and said second peroxy acid is preferably an aliphatic C2-C18 peroxy carboxylic acid including peracetic acid , perpropionic acid , peroxy phtalic acid , peroxy oxalic acid , peroxy malic acid , peroxy maleic acid and peroxy fumaric acid and mixtures thereof . Especially preferred are acetic acid and peracetic acid . The formation of the equilibrium mixtures of peroxy acids can be catalyzed by the addition of strong acids . The strong acids can be organic acids . Preferably , low molecular weight carboxylic acids can be used as reaction catalysts . Most preferably , formic acid can be used as a catalyst . Alternatively , the formation of the equilibrium mixtures of peroxy acids can be catalyzed by mineral acids . The mineral acids applicable for catalyzing the formation of peroxy acids include sulphuric acid , phosphoric acid , hydrochloric acid , pyrophosphoric acid and polyphosphoric acid and mixtures thereof . One advantage of for example a sulphuric acid catalyst is that it also forms a peroxy acid ( Caron acid ) to some extend . The amount of the acid catalyst can be from 0.1 to 20 % of the weight of the solution , more preferably from 1 to 10 % of the weight of the solution , most preferably from 1 to 5 % of the weight of the solution . In addition , ion exchange resins in their acidic forms can be used as a catalyst of said reaction . Additionally , conventional additives may be introduced into the solution . The additives include stabilizers such as phosphonates , e.g . 1-hydroxy ethylene-l,l-diphosphonic acid ( HEDPA ) , and pyridinecarboxylic acids , e.g . dipicolinic acid , chelating agents and radical scavengers . Also mixtures of stabilizers maybe employed . The amount of stabilizer( s ) may be from 0.01 to 1 % by weight , preferably from 0.05 to 0.5 % by weight . In a second aspect of the invention there is provided a storable solution comprising a first peroxy acid comprising performic acid , a second peroxy acid , a first carboxylic acid comprising formic acid , a second carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide , the amount of formic acid and performic acid being from 0.5 to 20 % by weight of the total amount of the second carboxylic acid and the second peroxy acid , and the amount of peroxy acids being at least 5 % by weight . In this specification the term " storable " means that the decrease of active oxygen ( peroxy acids + hydrogen peroxide ) in the peroxy acid solution is less than 20 % by mol after 7 days ' storage at room temperature . The decrease is preferably less than 15 % by mol , and more preferably less than 10 % by mol . The amount of peroxy acids in the solution is preferably from 5 to 20 % by weight , more preferably from 10 to 20 % by weight . The molar ratio of the peroxy acids and carboxylic acids to hydrogen peroxide in the solution is preferably in the range from 0.5:1 to 8:1 , more preferably from 0.7 :1 to 2:1. Said molar ratio may also be in the range from 2 : 1 to 8 : 1 . The solution is preferably an equilibrium solution . The amount of formic acid and performic acid in the solution is preferably from 2 to 20 % by weight . Said second carboxylic acid and said second peroxy acid are as defined above . Preferably the solution additionally comprises a stabilizer as defined above . The invention also relates to the use of the solution as defined above as a disinfecting agent for controlling micro-organisms . The solution of the invention may be used as a disinfecting agent for example in process water applications , greenhouses , dairy industry , I& I cleaning , P&P industry , for example for controlling microbial growth on paper machines etc . The peroxy acid solution may also be used as bleaching agent in pulp bleaching wherein it can be used e.g . as a post- bleaching agent of residual lignin . Additionally , the peroxy acid solution is an effective impregnating agent of wood chips before the preparation of mechanical pulp . Concentrated solutions of performic acid and peracetic acid according to the invention have superior effectiveness in the control of microbial growth in process waters , greenhouse nutrient solutions , disinfection of sewage waters etc . compared to pure peracetic acid solutions . Moreover , these PFA/PAA solutions can be prepared and stored for several weeks without remarkable decomposition . As the anti- microbial features of the said solutions are equal to performic acid solutions , the use of PFA/PAA solutions provides a safe alternative for the use of performic acid solutions . This is a remarkable advantage , since performic acid solutions are not storable and thus , they have to be prepared in situ prior to use . Another advantage compared to performic acid solutions is the improved safety factor . PFA/PAA solutions are comparable to pure PAA solution in terms of safety aspects . The good stability of the PFA/PAA solutions of the present invention was surprising , since performic acid solutions at higher concentrations are regarded to be unstable . Compared to the use of performic acid , these solutions of PAA and PFA provide a good alternative also in terms of corrosivity . By applying a mixture of PAA and PFA having the similar anti-microbial features as performic acid , the risk of the corrosion of the equipment is remarkably lower . As explained above up to 20 % by weight , preferably up to 15 % by weight of peracetic acid or another peroxy acid can be replaced by performic acid , still providing storable solutions . Following advantages can be obtained by the present invention : Firstly , a substantial amount of performic acid is formed into the solution and this should increase the disinfecting power of the peroxy acid solution . Secondly , peroxy acid solutions , suitable for greenhouse applications etc can be prepared and stored , whereas nowadays PFA solutions must be prepared in situ from the solutions of formic acid and hydrogen peroxide . Thirdly , the resulting peroxy acid solution could be used as bleaching agent in pulp bleaching wherein it can be used e.g . as a post- bleaching agent of residual lignin . Additionally , the peroxy acid mixture is an effective impregnating agent of wood chips before the preparation of mechanical pulp . hi this specification percentages refer to % by weight unless otherwise specified . The invention is explained in more detail in the following examples . Example 1 0.6 % , 3.04 % , 4.99 % , 10.04 % and 15.01 % solutions of formic acid ( FA ) in acetic acid ( AA ) were prepared . The solutions were mixed in molar ratio 2 : 1 ( AA /H2O2 ) with 50.5 % H2O2 . As stabilizers , phosphonate ( HEDPA , 500 mg/1 ) and dipicolinic acid ( DPA , 300 mg/1 ) were added into each solution . The resulting solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature . The solutions were stored in dark , at RT for 7 days and the concentrations of peroxy acid ( here calculated as peracetic acid ) and hydrogen peroxide were determined by titrations . After 3 d storage , 0.48 % of sulfuric acid was added to further catalyze the reaction . The total active oxygen content ( peracid + peroxide ) was determined for each sample . The test results are shown in following Tables 1 to 3. The stability % describes the ratio between the analyzed amount of peracid ( mol/kg ) + H2O2 ( mol/kg ) and the originally added H2O2 ( mol/kg ) .

The decrease of active oxygen ( peracid + peroxide ) indicates the decomposition of total peroxy acids when the amount of formic acid is increased in the starting solution . However , even when 15 % of acetic acid was substituted by formic acid , over 80 % of the active oxygen was preserved after 7 days ' storage . Example 2 Efficacy of PFA-PAA mixtures towards pre-grown biofilm on stainless steel surface Kemira has developed a new test intended for rapid efficacy testing of anti-biof[iota]lm agents . The test is disclosed in patent application WO 2005/045132 . m this assay different products are compared for their relative efficacy in inactivation/removal of pre-grown biofilms . The real situation in paper machines is often that it is not enough to prevent formation of new biofilms , but the anti-biofilm agents should also perform on pre - contaminated surfaces . In the new test pre-grown biofilms are exposed for a short time , and after that the viability of remaining biofilms is quantified . Biofilms were produced on the surfaces of stainless steel protrusions . This was achieved by immersing the steel plate with protrusions to a mixture of true primary-biofilrn formers of paper industry ( Deinococcus geothermalis , Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis and Meiothermus silvanus ) mixed with clear filtrate from a neutral board machine and cultivating in continuous shaking ( 2 d , 45 [deg.]C ) . Grown-up biofilms on the protrusions were exposed to different biocides for 1.5 hour at room temperature . The viability of remaining biofilms was measured by transferring the stainless steel plates to sterile R2 broth and incubating at 45 [deg.]C for 21 h . The amount of new biofilm formed indicated the survival rate of the original , treated biofilms . The tested biocides were : PFA-PAA : a mixture of performic acid and peracetic acid was prepared by mixing 5.9 g formic acid solution ( concentration 75 weight % ) to 44.6 g acetic acid solution ( concentration 99 weight % ) and 100 g hydrogen peroxide solution ( concentration 50 weight % ) was added to the carboxylic acid mixture by cooling . Additionally 2.0 g stabilizer and 7.5 g concentrated sulphuric acid was added . The peroxy acid content was 9.3 weight % and H2O2 content 28 weight % . ePAA : an equilibrium peracetic acid solution trade name Kemirox WT , containing 15 weight % of pure peracetic acid , 15 weight % hydrogen peroxide and 24 weight % acetic acid . The dosing of the mixture was based on the sum of peracids . Following doses were used 0, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7<1>Z2 , 10 and 15 ppm of PAA or a mixture of PAA and PFA , respectively . AU biocides were treated as active ingredient and weighted in deionized water and diluted in tap water . The test results show that the PFA-PAA mixture was a clearly better biocide than ePAA . A clear effect was observed with 3 ppm and a complete inactivation with 5 ppm . When an ordinary ePAA solution was applied a clear effect was not seen until 10 ppm concentration of PAA was applied . Even 15 ppm concentration of ePAA did not result in complete inactivation of the microbes . Based on the active PAA content , PFA-PAA mixture was 3 to 4 times more efficient than ePAA . As product , PFA-PAA was roughly two times more efficient than ePAA in biofilm inactivation . Claims 1 .

[0001] STABILIZED PROTEASE COMPOSITION Field of the invention The present invention relates to an enzyme composition in which the enzyme is stabilized by certain additives in an inventive combination . More particularly , the invention concerns a serine protease composition comprising a reversible inhibitor to the serine protease and an additional stabilizing agent M as defined below . Background Serine proteases are a group of proteolytic enzymes characterized by having a serine and a histidine residue in their active site . Many well known enzymes belong to this group , for example trypsin , kallikrein , thrombin and plasmin . Several of them have found practical use . Trypsin is used in the leather industry . Thrombin is used as a haemostatic agent to stop bleeding from wounds . Urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator , two other serine proteases , are used clinically as thrombolytic agents in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction . A number of these enzymes have been used extensively as research tools , for instance in protein structure determination . Furthermore , the enzymes are used in various diagnostic kits . Common to most of the serine proteases are their limited stability in solution . This is mainly caused by autodegradation when left in solution , caused by their property as proteases . This limited stability is a problem when the material has to be stored in solution . Commercial serine protease preparations available today are essentially always in the form of frozen solutions orlyophilized powders , with obvious drawbacks . The extra time needed for dissolution of the powder or thawing of the frozen solution to the correct temperature is the most important issue . There are , however , other problems with these preparations . For frozen solutions , there is a need for controlled temperatures (-20 <0>C ) in all steps from manufacture and transportation to storage . For lyophilized powders , there is a need for a reconstitution solution with an acceptable grade of purity and stability . Als .o , the material frequently needs to be prepared aseptically ( by mixing of the two parts ) in an environment which may be non-controlled ( such as inclement weather or lack of a clean water supply ) , and there is a need to verify that the powders have been properly mixed . These are all major drawbacks of the products available today , adding to their complexity , of use as well as their cost . For thrombin , which preferably has to be immediately available for use in arresting bleeding , the stability problems have forced manufacturers to use lyophilized thrombin or deep frozen solutions . These then require a certain amount of time to prepare for use . The two thrombolytic agents urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator are sold in the form of lyophilized preparations that have to be dissolved before use . Since thrombolytic treatment of acute myocardial infarction has to be started as early as possible after onset of the infarction , any time delay caused by such preparation is a problem . Many efforts have been made to find ways to stabilize the various serine proteases . For trypsin , which degrades itself fairly rapidly , a simple and efficient stabilizing agent is the calcium ion ( Sipos T and Merkel J , Biochemistry 9:2766 ( 1970 ) ) . Decreasing the pH to below 4 is also a method that works with some of the enzymes , like trypsin and plasmin , but is not feasible with thrombin , since it is irreversibly inactivated by a pH below 5 . Reversible protease inhibitors can be used , but are less popular , since they interfere in a detrimental fashion with the action of the enzyme when they are used by themselves ( see below ) . For stabilization of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA ) , addition of the amino acid arginine is conventionally used . The tPA material in clinical use today contains arginine as stabilizer . Also , a lot of effort has been devoted to find ways to stabilize thrombin solutions . As examples of stabilizing additives , the following proposals may be mentioned : carboxylic acids in high concentrations , EDTA , various amino acids , albumin , polymers such as polyethylene glycol , polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol , glycerol , various inorganic salts , carbohydrates , gelatin , collagen . Japanese patent application JP2004191367 describes a stabilized thrombin containing test reagent for testing blood coagulation ability . The test reagent contains thrombin and a thrombin inhibitor , and may also comprise one or more thrombin stabilizing compounds selected from calcium ion , an organic acid , a surfactant and a protein . WO 02/100830 , WO 02/22575 , WO 00/20394 , WO 99/11658 , WO 02/37937 and US 5,409,927 all describe different serine protease inhibiting compounds and their use in pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of various disease conditions , such as thrombosis , wherein inhibition of the corresponding serine proteases is indicated . Nakamura et al . {J. Chrom . Ar 1009 , ( 2003 ) , 133-139 ) describe the use of an immobilized protease inhibitor for affinity chromatography of trypsin-like proteases . Turner et al . {Biochemistry , 25 , ( 1986 ) , 4929-4935 ) describe three p-amidinophenyl esters that irreversibly inhibit human factor IXa . Tsung Fu Yang et al . {Biomacromolecules , 25 , ( 2004 ) , 1926-1932 ) describe the synthesis of a cationic polymer , N,N-diethylethylenediamin polyurethane , for use in gene delivery . US patent application 2001/0033837 ( corresponding to EP 1 136 084 Al ) describes a thrombin preparation containing a non-covalently bound inhibitor as stabilizer . Furthermore , the inhibitor is combined with other stabilizing additives , like sugars or carboxylic acids , which have been previously described in patents or other publications . JP 2000300250 describes the stabilization of thrombin solutions by addition of polyvinyl alcohol , gelatin or polyvinyl pyrrolidone in different buffer solutions . In GB 1354761 , proteases and amylases are stabilized to various extents by a number of substances , such as aliphatic alcohols , carboxylic acids , heterocyclic compounds containing hydroxyl groups , and aliphatic or alicyclic amines . Thus , stabilization of a serine protease using inhibitors has been described ( for example US 2001/0033837 and JP 2004191367 , supra ) . The problem with this approach is that the inhibitor strongly diminishes the effect of the enzyme , if it is not removed prior to use of the preparation . If a potent inhibitor is used , most of the enzymatic activity is lost . A better approach is to use a reversible inhibitor of intermediate strength . However , even in this case , a considerable part of the initial enzymatic activity will be lost as concentration of the inhibitor is increased in order to get a good stabilization effect . Disclosure of the invention It is therefore an object of the present invention to accomplish a serine protease composition , which is stable in solution and retains a degree of enzymatic activity which is sufficient for practical use of the composition . It is another object of the present invention to provide a serine protease composition , which is amenable to direct use without prior steps of preparation from deep frozen or lyophilized material . It is a further object of the present invention to enable practical use of reversible inhibitors of serine proteases for stabilization purposes , through the provision of an additional stabilizing component . These , and other objects apparent from the present text , are attained by the different aspects of the present invention as claimed . Thus , one aspect of the invention provides a stabilized serine protease composition comprising a ) a serine protease ; b ) a reversible inhibitor of said serine protease ; and c ) a stabilizing agent M having the formula I : [0019] EMI6.1 wherein n is 0, 1 or 2 ; X is O , N or CH2 ; R<1->-R<4> are the same or different , and selected from H , -CH2-R<6> , -CH2-O-R<6> , -CH2-S-R<6> , -CH2-NH-R<6> , -CO-O-R<6> , -CO-NH-R<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-R<6> , -CH2-O-CO-R<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-NHR<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-OR<6> , -CH2-NH-CS-NHR<6> and -CH2-O-CO-NHR<6> ; R<5> is as R<3^>-R<4> or P-Q ; P is selected from -(CH2 )* - and - ( CH2)m-Y- ( CH2)m-, wherein m is 1-6 and Y is 0, NH or S ; Q is selected from H , -SO3 , -COOH , -NH2 , -OH and -CONH2 ; each R<6> individually being selected from H , substituted or non-substituted lower alkyl , substituted or non-substituted cycloalkyl , substituted or non - substituted benzyl , substituted or non-substituted aryl or mono-, bi-, or tricyclic unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic ring( s ) with one or more heteroatoms and non-aromatic heterocycles , the substituents of the substituted groups being selected from lower alkyl , halogens , substituted or non-substituted aryl , substituted or non-substituted hetero-aromatic compounds , non-aromatic heterocycles , alkyloxy , alkylamino ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof . The present invention derives from initial results from a study on the stability of thrombin , in which it was surprisingly found that the inventive combination of a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme and a stabilizing agent M as defined above had a strong stabilizing effect on the enzyme in solution . Both the thrombin inhibitor and the stabilizing agent M alone had stabilization effects on thrombin , but the combination was several fold better than any of them ( see Example 1 ) . Thus , when a low concentration of enzyme inhibitor was combined with morpholine , MOPS or related compounds , a very strong stabilizing effect on the enzyme was obtained . Some tested compositions were stable , as indicated by less than 30 % decrease in activity , for more than 2 months at 37 <0>C. This would , according to data in prior publications and confirmed by the present inventors , correspond to 6 months at room temperature or 2.5 years at refrigerator temperature . The results from the initial study were expanded to include experiments on other serine proteases , and in these experiments the surprising stabilizing effect was also observed . As exemplified below , the composition according to the invention exhibits a substantially improved stability as compared to enzyme compositions without the inventive combination of ingredients b ) and c ) . With the inventive approach , a low concentration of serine protease inhibitor may be used , and a satisfactory degree of stabilization still obtained . For example , the concentration of the inhibitor may be lower than what has been suggested previously , e g in US 2001/0033837 . With such a low concentration of inhibitor , much more of the enzymatic activity is retained in the stabilized enzyme solution . It should be noted that the increase in stabilization due to the combination of the reversible serine protease inhibitor and stabilizing agent M is not regarded as an additional inhibitory effect provided by M. In fact M , as described in Illustrative Example A , may lack any serine protease inhibiting capacity . Without wishing to be bound by theory , the present inventors believe that the surprisingly increased stabilizing effect observed is achieved through a beneficial synergy between reversible serine protease inhibitors and stabilizing agents M of the inventive composition . The present invention provides such a combination of a reversible serine protease inhibitor and stabilizing agent M in a stabilized serine protease composition and use of such a combination for stabilizing a serine protease composition . In an embodiment of the invention , the serine protease in the composition is selected from the group consisting of trypsin , kallikrein , thrombin , plasmin , urokinase , tissue plasminogen activator , active form of factor IX , active form of factor X and active form of factor XI. In a more specific ' embodiment , the serine protease is thrombin . In another specific embodiment , the serine protease is plasmin . In yet another specific embodiment , the serine protease is trypsin . Reversible inhibitors to serine proteases are known to persons of skill in the art , and which one is the optimal to use will vary depending on what specific serine protease is used . In general , it is of importance for the intended effect that the inhibitor is not of great strength . In other words , the inhibitory effect has to be moderate enough that the enzymatic activity remains usefully high . As a guideline , it has been found that inhibitors having a Ki of between 0.01 mM and 2 mM are suitable for use in the composition according to the invention , with from 0.04 mM to 0.5 mM as a preferred range . In one embodiment , in which the serine protease is thrombin , the reversible inhibitor may be selected from N- ( 2' -phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin and derivatives thereof , benzamidine , N , N-diethylethylenediamine , aminobenzamidine , amidinopyridin and tert-butylamidin . In another embodiment , in which the serine protease is thrombin , the reversible inhibitor is selected from N- ( 2' -phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin and derivatives thereof , N , N- diethylethylenediamine , amidinopyridin and tert- butylamidin . In a more specific embodiment , in which the serine protease is thrombin , the reversible inhibitor is N- ( 2' -phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin or a derivative thereof . In another embodiment , in which the serine protease is plasmin , the reversible inhibitor is selected from N , N- diethylethylenediamine , aminobenzamidine and benzamidine . In another embodiment , in which the serine protease is trypsin , the reversible inhibitor is selected from aminobenzamidine and benzamidine . These combinations of enzymes and inhibitors are illustrative examples , and are not to be interpreted as limiting . In one embodiment of the invention , the value of n in formula I is 1 or 2. In a more specific embodiment , n in formula I is 1 . The composition according to the invention comprises a stabilizing agent M with the general formula I given above . In embodiments of the invention , stabilizing agent M is a compound of formula II : [0031] EMI9.1 wherein R<3->-R<4> are the same or different , and selected from H , -CH2-R<6> ; R<5> is as R<3->-R<4> or P-Q ; P is selected from - ( CH2 ) m - and - ( CH2 ) m-Y- ( CH2 ) m-, wherein m is 1-6 and Y is 0, NH or S ; Q is selected from H , -SO3 , -COOH , -NH2 , -OH and -CONH2 ; each R<6> individually being selected from H , substituted or non-substituted lower alkyl , substituted or non-substituted cycloalkyl , substituted or non - substituted benzyl , substituted or non-substituted aryl or mono-, bi-, or tricyclic unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic ring( s ) with one or more heteroatoms and non-aromatic heterocycles , the substituents of the substituted groups being selected from lower alkyl , halogens , substituted or non-substituted aryl , substituted or non-substituted hetero-aromatic compounds , non-aromatic heterocycles , alkyloxy , alkylamino ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof . Accordingly , in some embodiments , stabilizing agent M is a compound of formula III : [0034] EMI10.1 wherein R<5> is -CH2-R<6> or P-Q ; P is selected from -(CH2)m - or - ( CH2 ) m-Y- ( CH2 ) m-, wherein m is 1-6 and Y is 0, NH or S ; Q is selected from H , -SO3 , -COOH , -NH2 , -OH and -CONH2 . each R<6> individually being selected from substituted or non-substituted lower alkyl , substituted or non - substituted cycloalkyl , substituted or non-substituted benzyl , substituted or non-substituted aryl , the substituents of the substituted groups being selected from lower alkyl , halogens , substituted or non - substituted aryl , substituted or non-substituted hetero-aromatic compounds , non-aromatic heterocycles , alkyloxy , alkylamino ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof . In some embodiments of the invention , stabilizing agent M is selected from the group consisting of morpholine , 3- (N-morpholino ) propanesulfonic acid ( MOPS) , morpholino butyl sulphonic acid , morpholino propyl carboxylic acid , morpholino ethyl alcohol and morpholino ethyl sulphonic acid . Thus , examples of compounds M for use in the compositions of this aspect of the invention are morpholine and 3- (N-morpholino ) propanesulfonic acid ( MOPS) . In a specific embodiment of the invention , stabilizing agent M is morpholine .

Another composition according to the invention which shows the stabilization effect is one in which the serine protease is plasmin , the reversible inhibitor is aminobenzamidine and stabilizing agent M is morpholine . In serine protease compositions for topical administration , e g to a wound site , it has been a problem that the composition can easily flow or be rinsed from the site where it is applied . In order to solve this problem , it is possible to add to the enzyme composition an adhesive polymer , which then serves the purpose of making the composition more viscous and adherent to skin or wound sites . As an embodiment of the present invention , such an addition of an adhesive polymer to the inventive composition may have an additional unexpected and beneficial effect on its stability . The addition of a polymer then serves the double purpose of increasing the viscosity and adhesiveness of the composition , at the same time as it helps the stabilization of the enzyme even further . In some embodiments of the invention , the composition further comprises a viscous and adhesive polymer selected from polysaccharides and gelatin . Thus , the polymer may for example be a polysaccharide , such as selected from starch , its derivatives , cellulose , its derivatives , and mixtures thereof . Specific , non-limiting examples of starches useful as additives to the composition according to the invention include corn starch and potato starch and mixtures thereof , whereas non-limiting examples of useful cellulose derivatives are carboxymethyl cellulose and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose and mixtures thereof . In a specific embodiment the polysaccharide is carboxymethyl chitosan . In further embodiments of the invention , said polysaccharide is present in a concentration of 0.1-5 % . However , it is also envisaged that the polymer is gelatin , such as gelatin from a cold water fish . In some embodiments of the invention , said gelatin is present in a concentration of 0.5-20 % .

In a more specific embodiment , said stabilizing agent M is present in a concentration of 0.1-0.3 M. According to another aspect thereof , the present invention provides use of a composition as described above as a medicament . Another aspect of the invention concerns use of said composition , in which the serine protease is thrombin , for the preparation of a medicament for establishing haemostasis in a subject suffering from a bleeding . A related aspect of the invention provides a method for establishing haemostasis in a subject suffering from a bleeding , comprising applying a composition according to the invention , in which composition the serine protease is thrombin , to the site of bleeding in an amount sufficient to diminish or stop said bleeding . In connection with such a use or method employing a thrombin composition according to the invention as a medicament , the stability of the inventive composition offers benefits in the circumstances in which it is used . Often , thrombin compositions are used in the context of emergency situations , wherein it is crucial to stop subjects from bleeding . In these same situations , the use of conventional , haemostatic thrombin preparations is difficult , since they often require cumbersome and time - consuming steps of thawing ( if frozen ) and/or dissolution ( if lyophilized ) . The present invention enables the production of e g such haemostatic agents in the form of solutions , whose stability is such that they can readily be stored during extended periods of time , for example in an ambulance or an emergency helicopter , until needed at the site of an accident or the like . At this time , they may be used as is , without any delay due to preparation . The conventional preparations used to stop bleeding contain fairly high concentrations of thrombin , between 200-1000 activity units/ml . In connection with plastic surgery applications , this is seen as a risk for increased scar formation . Low thrombin concentration solutions are presently prepared in the clinic by dilution of concentrated thrombin solutions . No ready to use preparation is available . Therefore , in a further aspect thereof , the present invention provides a stabilized thrombin composition with a considerably lower concentration of thrombin , between 5-20 activity units/ml , and use thereof in plastic surgery . Another aspect of the invention exploits the known properties of plasmin , urokinase or tPA as thrombolytic agents . Thus , the invention provides use of a composition as described above , in which the serine protease is selected from plasmin , urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator , for the preparation of a medicament for thrombolytic treatment . A related aspect provides a method for thrombolytic treatment in a subject in need thereof , comprising administering a composition as described above , in which composition the serine protease is selected from plasmin , urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator , to the subject in an amount sufficient for said treatment . In these two related aspects , the thrombolytic treatment in question may , as non-limiting examples , be performed in order to treat myocardial infarction or in order to treat stroke . As mentioned in the context of the composition aspect of the invention , the increase in stabilization due to the combination of the reversible serine protease inhibitor and stabilizing agent M is not regarded as an additional inhibitory effect provided by M. In fact M , as described in Illustrative Example A , may lack any serine protease inhibiting capacity . Without wishing to be bound by theory , the present inventors believe that the surprisingly increased stabilizing effect observed is achieved through a beneficial synergy between reversible serine protease inhibitors and stabilizing agents M of the inventive composition . Therefore , in another aspect thereof , the invention provides the use of a combination of a ) a reversible serine protease inhibitor and b ) a stabilizing agent M of formula I : [0053] EMI15.1 wherein n is 0 , 1 or 2 ; X is 0, N or CH2 ; R<1>--^<4> are the same or different , and selected from H , -CH2-R<6> , -CH2-O-R<6> , -CH2-S-R<6> , -CH2-NH-R<6> , -CO-O-R<6> , -CO-NH-R<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-R<6> , -CH2-O-CO-R<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-NHR<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-OR<6> , -CH2-NH-CS-NHR<6> and -CH2-O-CO-NHR<6> ; R<5> is as R-R<4> or P-Q ; P is selected from - ( CH2 ) m - and - ( CH2 ) m-Y- ( CH2 ) m-, wherein m is 1-6 and Y is 0, NH or S ; Q is selected from H , -SO3 , -COOH , -NH2 , -OH and -CONH2 ; each R<6> individually being selected from H , substituted or non-substituted lower alkyl , substituted or non-substituted cycloalkyl , substituted or non - substituted benzyl , substituted or non-substituted aryl or mono-, bi-, or tricyclic unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic ring( s ) with one or more heteroatoms and non-aromatic heterocycles , the substituents of the substituted groups being selected from lower alkyl , halogens , substituted or non-substituted aryl , substituted or non-substituted hetero-aromatic compounds , non-aromatic heterocycles , alkyloxy , alkylamino ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof ; for stabilizing a serine protease composition , wherein the reversible serine protease inhibitor and the stabilizing agent M act in synergy to provide a serine protease stabilizing effect . In this inventive use of a combination of a reversible serine protease inhibitor and a stabilizing agent for stabilization of a serine protease composition , the choices of particular components that may be used and substituents for compounds M are as discussed above in relation to the composition aspect of the invention . In yet another aspect , the invention provides a method for the stabilization of a serine protease , which comprises admixing the serine protease with a ) a reversible inhibitor of said serine protease ; and b ) a stabilizing agent M of formula I : [0058] EMI16.1 wherein n is 0, 1 or 2 ; X is O , N or CH2 ; R<3->-R<4> are the same or different , and selected from H , -CH2-R<6> , -CH2-O-R<6> , -CH2-S-R<6> , -CH2-NH-R<6> , -CO-O-R<6> , -CO-NH-R<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-R<6> , -CH2-O-CO-R<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-NHR<6> , -CH2-NH-CO-OR<6> , -CH2-NH-CS-NHR<6> and -CH2-O-CO-NHR<6> ; R<5> is as R-R<4> or P-Q ; P is selected from - ( CH2 ) m - and - ( CH2 ) m-Y- ( CH2 ) m-, wherein m is 1-6 and Y is 0, NH or S ; Q is selected from H , -SO3 , -COOH , -NH2 , -OH and -CONH2 ; each R<6> individually being selected from H , substituted or non-substituted lower alkyl , substituted or non-substituted cycloalkyl , substituted or non - substituted benzyl , substituted or non-substituted aryl or mono-, bi-, or tricyclic unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic ring( s ) with one or more heteroatoms and non-aromatic heterocycles , the substituents of the substituted groups being selected from lower alkyl , halogens , substituted or non-substituted aryl , substituted or non-substituted hetero-aromatic compounds , non-aromatic heterocycles , alkyloxy , alkylamino ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof . In this inventive method for stabilization of a serine protease composition , the choices of particular components that may be used and substituents for compounds M are as discussed above in relation to the composition aspect of the invention . A further aspect of the invention concerns the use of the composition as described above for adsorption onto a solid object , in order that this solid object may provide the enzymatic activity in question . In particular , it is of interest in many surgical applications to enter and , in particular , exit arteries while inflicting as little damage from bleeding as possible . In order to stop bleeding from an artery , it has previously been suggested to use a form of "arterial plug" ( such objects are also known as vascular sealing devices , femoral access closure devices ( when the femoral artery is used for entry , e g in angiography ) , vascular hemostasis devices and puncture closure devices ) , for example made from collagen or another biodegradable material . According to the present aspect of the invention , such a plug may advantageously be coated with a composition according to the invention , in which the serine protease is thrombin . Such a plug achieves faster sealing of the opening of the artery , in that the thrombin of the composition aids in blood clotting around the plug. Thus , the invention provides , in this aspect , a vascular haemostasis device having an amount of the composition according to the invention , in which the serine protease is thrombin , adsorbed on it . The vascular haemostasis device is preferably made from a biodegradable solid or semi-solid material , such as collagen , chitosan or other biological polymer . Another aspect of the invention concerns the novel identification of N,N-diethylethylenediamine as a serine protease inhibitor . Thus , in this aspect , the invention provides use of N , N-diethylethylenediamine as an inhibitor of a serine protease , as well as a method of inhibiting a serine protease , comprising admixing therewith an inhibitory amount of N , N-diethylethylenediamine . In some embodiments of this aspect of the invention , the serine protease is plasmin . In other embodiments of this aspect of the invention , the serine protease is thrombin . It is generally preferred , for the realization of all the advantages of the invention 's different aspects , that the composition according to the invention is in a form selected from a solution and a gel . In this regard , aqueous solutions and aqueous gels are more preferred .

Pharmaceutical formulations may be found e g in Remington : The Science and Practice of Pharmacy , 19 edition , Mack Printing Company , Easton , Pennsylvania ( 1995 ) . As detailed in the description of the invention , a possible choice of inhibitor for use in the composition and methods according to the invention is "N- ( 2' - phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin and derivatives there .of" .

Examples The following examples illustrate the invention , and are not to be interpreted as limiting . In the following description of experiments conducted in accordance with the present invention , the time it takes to reach 70 % of the initial activity is used as a numerical value for the stability of an enzyme solution . This value , denoted " T 70 % " , is chosen since it corresponds to what could be accepted as a maximum permitted loss in activity during a life span of a commercial product . In the experimental studies , a high temperature ( 37 <0>C ) has been used , as well as a high concentration of enzyme . This has been made in order to obtain stability data in reasonably short times , and not have to wait for months or years . The stability 's dependency on temperature has been studied , and the results given in Example 1 . This study showed that the inactivation process is about 3 times slower at room temperature , and around 20 times slower at refrigerator temperature , than the process actually measured ( at 37 <0>C ) . Furthermore , the inactivation process is concentration dependent , and is more rapid at higher concentrations of the enzyme . The concentration of thrombin used in Example 1 was 1 mg/ml ( or 3300 units/ml ) , i e higher than the 0.1-0.3 mg/ml used in present commercially available preparations and/or devices . Studies of the concentration dependency has shown that the inactivation process is 3-4 times slower at those concentrations as compared to the concentration used in Example 1 . Taking this together would give a factor of between 10-12 , with which to multiply the T 70 % value in order to arrive at what corresponds to room temperature storage conditions for a commercial product containing a serine protease , such as a haemostatic preparation containing thrombin . In Table 1 , the composition with N- ( 2'-phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridine and MOPS has a T 70 % of 120 days . That would correspond to a value , for a 0.1-0.3 mg/ml product , of more than 1200 days in room temperature conditions , i e more than three years . This clearly exceeds anything previously accomplished , regarding the stabilization of thrombin in solution . Example 1 - Stabilization of human thrombin To determine the coagulant activity of thrombin solutions , the time to clotting of a fibrinogen solution ( 1.3 mg/ml ) after additions of various dilutions of a solution of a particular human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) was measured . The clotting times were measured using an Amelungen Kc 1 coagulometer ( Amelungen , Germany ) . To study the stabilities of thrombin solutions with different additives , the samples were incubated in a thermostat chamber kept at 37 <0>C. Aliquots were taken out at various time intervals , and the remaining thrombin activity in these aliquots was measured . From the values obtained , activity decay curves could be constructed . Activity decay curves of 1 mg/ml thrombin solutions in 10 mM HEPES , 0.13 M NaCl buffer , pH 7.4 , showed T 70 % values around 1.6 days at 37 <0>C. Corresponding experiments at room temperature (around 21 <0>C ) showed a T 70 % value of 5.4 days , whereas after refrigerator storage (around 5 <0>C ) , the T 70 % value was 36 days . Thus , as expected , there is a strong temperature dependency . Solutions containing 1 mg/ml of thrombin in 10 mM HEPES and 0.13 M NaCl at pH 7.4 with the indicated stabilizing additive ( s ) were put in the thermostat chamber , and their activity decay curves were determined . The results obtained are shown in Table 1 . Data on the corresponding 1 mg/ml thrombin solution without additives is included for comparison . [0092 ] EMI24.1 It is evident that the tested compounds all have a stabilizing effect . However , there is a synergistic effect of combinations of inhibitor and morpholine - containing compound in accordance with the invention , as evidenced by the superior results obtained with such combinations . As the table above illustrates , the addition of 0.20 M MOPS alone gives an increase in stabilization by a factor of 4.7 , and the addition of 0.5 mM of the reversible thrombin inhibitor aminobenzamidine gives a stabilization increase by a factor of 12.5 . The inventive combination , however , stabilizes the thrombin composition much better , by a factor of 42.5 . The inventive combination of MOPS and N,N-diethylethylenediamine is also better at stabilizing the enzyme than the individual components . Likewise , the combination of 0.20 M MOPS and 1.9 mM N- ( 2<r > -phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin is seen to confer a very high stabilization increase , a factor of 75 , whereas the individual components increase stability by a factor of 4.7 and 22 , respectively . The thrombin used in the study is human thrombin derived from plasma . Recombinant human thrombin has also been studied and has essentially shown the same behavior . Example 2 - Stabilization of bovine thrombin Stabilization of bovine thrombin was studied . The experimental setup was the same as in Example 1 , but the concentration of bovine thrombin ( Baxter ) used was 0.4 mg/ml . Upon storage at 37 [deg.]C , the thrombin solution in HEPES buffer showed a T 70 % value of 1.3 days . The thrombin solution in HEPES buffer plus 3.0 mM N- ( 2' - phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin and 0.20 M MOPS showed a T 70 % value of 54 days . The results obtained show that bovine thrombin is somewhat more labile than the preparations of human thrombin studied , but that a very good stabilizing effect is nevertheless obtained by the compositions of the invention . Example 3 - Low concentrations of thrombin Stabilization of thrombin in compositions containing low concentrations of thrombin was studied . The stabilizing effect of the compositions according to the invention was demonstrated to work also for comparatively low concentrations of thrombin . A 15.0 activity units/ml solution of human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) in HEPES buffer , pH 7.4 , showed a T 70 % value of 23 days . The corresponding solution in HEPES buffer , pH 7.4 , plus 2.0 mM N- ( 2' -phenoxy ) -4-aminopyridin and 0.20 M MOPS exhibited a T 70 % value of 92 days . Example 4 - Stabilization of plasmin The stabilization of solutions of plasmin in accordance with the invention was tested . The activity of plasmin was determined using chromogenic peptide substrate Chromozym TH ( Pentapharm , Switzerland ) and measurement of absorbance change at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer . Solutions containing 100 [mu]g/ml of plasmin ( specific activity 3.2 units/mg , Sigma-Aldrich ) in 10 mM HEPES and 0.13 M NaCl , pH 7.4 , as well as stabilizers as indicated in Table 2 below were incubated at 37 <0>C , and samples were taken out at various time intervals for activity determination . The results obtained are shown in Table 2. [0102 ] EMI26.1 From these results , it is evident that a very strong stabilization is obtained using the combination in accordance with the invention . 0.20 M morpholine increases the stability of the plasmin composition by a factor of 4 , 0.13 M N,N-diethylethylenediamine by a factor of 2.7 and 1.3 mM aminobenzamidine by a factor of 17 . However , the combination of morpholine and N , N- diethylethylenediamine increases the stability of the plasmin composition by a factor of 7.3 , and the combination of morpholine and aminobenzamidine increases the stability by a factor of 72 . Example 5 - Stabilization of trypsin The stabilization of solutions of trypsin in accordance with the invention was tested . The activity of trypsin was determined using tosyl arginine methyl ester ( TAME) as substrate and measuring the absorbance change at 247 nm in a spectrophotometer . Solutions containing 100 [mu]g/ml of trypsin ( TPCK-treated , Sigma-Aldrich ) in 10 mM HEPES and 0.13 M NaCl , pH 7.4 , as well as stabilizers as indicated in Table 3 below were incubated at 37 [deg.]C , and samples were taken out at various time intervals for activity determination . The results obtained are shown in Table 3. [0105 ] EMI27.1 Again , the stabilizing effect is the greatest in the composition according to the invention . Thus , 0.5 M morpholine alone gives an increase in stabilization by a factor of 13 , and 1 mM benzamidine alone gives an increase in stabilization by a factor of 72 . The inventive combination , on the other hand , gives an increase in stabilization by a factor of 147 . Example 6 - Stabilization of thrombin with CMC Tests of thrombin solutions containing between 1.0 and 2.0 % carboxymethyl cellulose ( CMC) for their adhesiveness to human skin showed that the addition of CMC increased both viscosity and adhesiveness strongly . Surprisingly , however , it was also found that the stability of these thrombin solutions was further increased . A 1 mg/ml human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) solution in 0.5 mM aminobenzamidine , 0.20 M MOPS , 10 mM HEPES , 0.13 M NaCl being 2.0 % with respect to CMC was incubated at 37 [deg.]C , and the activity decay curve was determined . The T 70 % value obtained was 175 days . Example 7 - Stabilization with other adhesive polymers Four other polymers were also studied : ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose ( EHEC ) , potato starch , corn starch and cold water fish gelatin . All four of these polymers increased the adhesiveness and viscosity of thrombin solutions . The compatibility and stability of thrombin solutions with the polymers were further studied by incubation at 37 <0>C of 1 mg/ml human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) solutions in 0.20 M MOPS , 0.5 mM aminobenzamidine , 10 mM HEPES , 0.13 M NaCl , pH 7.4 , containing the various polymers . The concentrations of the polymers used were : EHEC , 0.6 % ; the two different starches , 4.0 % ; and gelatin , 12.8 % . EHEC was fully compatible with thrombin , and the same T 70 % value , i .e . around 65 days , was obtained as with the corresponding solution without EHEC . The starch containing solutions had T 70 % values of 22 and 26 days . The stability of thrombin was very good in gelatin with a T 70 % value of more than 90 days , which demonstrates additional stabilizing effect of cold water fish gelatin . Example 8 - Bleeding experiments The ability of inventive compositions to stop bleeding was tested in a series of experiments on rabbits . The model chosen was incisions in the liver which is a frequently used model . The abdomen of the rabbit was opened and the liver exposed . Standardized cuts of 3 mm length were made in the liver surface and an 0.10 ml amount of test solution was applied to the wound using a syringe . The time to haemostasis was measured . 10-12 experiments were performed with each solution . An average value of bleeding time was calculated after removal of the highest and the lowest value in each series of experiments . For comparison , the commonly used haemostatic agent Tisseel ( Baxter ) , a fibrin glue , was also included in the study . Tisseel was used essentially according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 0.2 ml of solution was applied to each wound using a double syringe with a mixing chamber . The results obtained are given in Table 4 below . [0110] EMI30.1 As is evident from these results , the thrombin solution stabilized according to the invention is the 5 most effective in quickly establishing haemostasis in a bleeding subject , comparable to or better than a commonly used agent . Example 9 - Compatibility with porous materials 0 A solution containing 0.4 mg/ml human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) in 10 mM HEPES , 0.14 M NaCl , 0.5 mM aminobenzamidine , 0.20 M MOPS of pH 7.4 was adsorbed into a piece of polyurethane plaster ( marketed as Ligasone by 5 Hartmann Scandicare AB , Anderstorp , Sweden ) . An amount of solution sufficient to saturate the polyurethane piece was used . The piece was transferred to a tube , which was then closed to prevent evaporation . The tube was kept at 37 <0>C , and samples of solution were taken out at 0 intervals by a slight pressure on the polyurethane piece . The activity decay curve showed a T 70 % value of 74 days , corresponding to a stability increase by a factor of 46 . Example 10 - Adsorption of enzyme onto a solid phase Adsorption of thrombin in stabilizing solutions to surfaces was tested . Solid flakes of chitosan ( at least 85 % deacetylated , Sigma-Aldrich ) , around 3 x 3 mm , were incubated for 10 minutes in solutions of 400 units/ml human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) in 10 mM HEPES , 0.13 M NaCl , pH 7.4. The solutions had the following additions : 1 ) none , 2 ) 0.10 M morpholine , 2 mM N- ( 2' -phenoxy ) -4-amino - pyridine , 3 ) 0.10 M morpholine , 2 mM N- [ 2' -phenoxy ) -4- aminopyridine , 0.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose . The flakes were then taken up and dried on filter paper . To get a measure of thrombin clotting activity , a flake was put in a test tube and 0.4 ml of 1.3 mg/ml fibrinogen solution was added . To improve clot detection , the tube also contained a small steel ball . The clotting times obtained initially on flakes from the various incubation mixtures varied between 1 to 4 minutes . After incubation in Eppendorf tubes at 37 [deg.]C for 7 days , the clotting times for flakes incubated in solution 1 ) were strongly prolonged . The values were between 24 and 27 minutes . In contrast , the clotting times for flakes incubated in solutions 2 ) and 3 ) were in the range of from 1 to 2.5 minutes , i e the same as the starting values . Evidently , a strong stabilization of thrombin activity is obtained by using solutions 2 ) and 3 ) . To test the in vivo haemostatic activity chitosan flakes incubated in solution 3 ) were applied to wounds in rabbit liver according to the animal model described in Example 8. The average time to haemostasis was 27 seconds ( based on six experiments ) . Illustrative Example A - Morpholine is not a thrombin inhibitor The possibility that morpholine is an inhibitor of thrombin was evaluated . The fibrinogen clotting activity of thrombin is usually measured by clotting tests , wherein the time to coagulation of a fibrinogen solution is detected by mechanical or optical devices . The clotting tests in this experimental setup were performed in 0.01 M HEPES , 0.13 M NaCl buffer of pH 7.4 , which is according to standard procedure ( EU Pharmacopeia ) . A human thrombin ( derived from plasma , 3300 units/mg , Biovitrum AB , Sweden ) solution containing 89 units/ml was used and dilutions of 1/5 , 1/10 and 1/16 were tested . Solutions of various concentrations of morpholine were prepared in the HEPES buffer by adding a concentrated morpholine solution adjusted to pH 7.4. When morpholine is dissolved in water , the pH goes up to 9-10 , so HCl was added to get a pH of 7.4. That also increased the ionic strength of the solution . Table I shows the results obtained . Observed clotting times were converted to concentrations of thrombin using a standard curve . [0115 ] EMI32.1 As evident from these results , there was a prolongation of clotting times with increasing concentration of morpholine up to a certain level . However , the same thing was observed when the ionic strength was increased with NaCl , and a similar profile was exhibited . Thus , the prolongation effect was , in all likelihood , caused by the increase in ionic strength . Further , it is known that an increase of ionic strength from 0.15 M to 0.22 M causes a change in the polymerization of fibrin ( B. Blomback , Thrombosis Research , vol . 83 , ( 1996 ) , p.1-75 , especially p.18 ) . This actually corresponds to the range studied in this experimental series , in which the initial concentration of NaCl was 0.13 M and then increased to 0.18 M and onwards up to 0.33 M. This also corresponds to the plateau level observed . In conclusion , morpholine itself is not an inhibitor of thrombin . CLAIMS 1 .

The salt may by formed by any cosmetically acceptable cation which means any metal cation as well as any organic cation that is not toxic to the skin and/or does not cause allergic reactions . Examples of such cations are ammonium salts and alkyl ammonium salts , alkali cations such as sodium and potassium ions and alkaline earth metal cations such as calcium und magnesium ions . In one embodiment of the present invention the aliphatic fatty acid is a saturated straight- chain fatty acid or [omega] - branched-chain fatty acid which preferably has 6 to 18 carbon atoms . In another embodiment the aliphatic fatty acid is a saturated straight-chain or [omega] - branched chain fatty acid which has 6 to 18 carbon atoms and is substituted , preferably by hydroxy , between the positions C6 and C12 . A particularly preferred fatty acid is 9- hydroxy stearic acid . In a further aspect , the invention is concerned with cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions comprising a fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above , and a retinoid . Retinoids for use in the invention are , e.g. , retinoic acid or retinol and isomers , e.g . 9-, 11- or 13-cis isomers thereof , and derivatives thereof which comprise retinyl esters such as the acetate , phenylbutyrate , propanoate , laurate , palmitate , oleate , linoleate ; or retinyl alkyl carbonate ; or ethers such as retinoxytrimethylsilane ; or ( all trans)-retinal or its acetals ; or retinoic acid or amides thereof such as methoxy PEG-12 retinamide ( "PEG-12 " = -(CH2-CH2-O-)12 ) . More specifically , the invention is concerned with cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above , and optionally one retinoid , for the treatment or prevention of symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin , as well as for the promotion of hair growth and protection from hair loss . Treatment or prevention of symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin comprises treatment or prevention of wrinkles or dry skin or sensitive skin , thickening of the epidermis , inhibition of senescence of skin cells , prevention or treatment of photodamage , prevention or treatment of oxidative stress phenomena , prevention or treatment of cellulite , prevention and treatment of disturbances in ceramide and lipid synthesis , prevention of excess sebum production , reduction of activities of matrix metallo proteases or other proteases in the skin , treatment and prevention of inflammatory skin conditions including acne ( = anti-acne ) , atopic eczema , polymorphic light eruption , psoriasis and vertiligo . In still another aspect , the invention is concerned with a method of treatment or prevention of symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin as well as treatment or prevention of itchy or irritated skin and of promotion of hair growth and of protection from hair loss which method provides topically administering to a person in need of such treatment or prevention an effective amount of a fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above , optionally and preferably in combination with a retinoid and preferably in the form of a cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition according to the invention . A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating or preventing wrinkles or human dry skin or sensitive skin , of promoting hair growth , of protecting from hair loss and of thickening the epidermis , which method comprises the step of topically administering to a person in need of such treatment or prevention an effective amount of a fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above , optionally and preferably in combination with a retinoid . A further object of the present invention is a method for the prevention or treatment of pigmentation disorders and/or for providing an even skin tone , which method comprises the step of topically administering to a person in need of such prevention or treatment an effective amount of a composition according to the present invention as defined above , wherein the composition contains a retinoid . Another object of the present invention is a method for fortifying the pigmentation which method comprises the step of topically administering to a person in need of such fortification an effective amount of a composition according to the present invention as defined above and topically administering a tanning active , wherein the tanning active may be administered before , after or simultaneously with the administration of the effective amount of the composition according to the present invention , and wherein any retinoid is essentially absent in such a composition . The term 'an effective amount ' refers to an amount necessary to obtain a physiological effect . The physiological effect may be achieved by one application dose or by repeated applications . The dosage administered may , of course , vary depending upon known factors , such as the physiological characteristics of the particular composition comprising the fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above , optionally in combination with a retinoid and its mode and route of administration ; the age , health and weight of the recipient ; the nature and extent of the symptoms ; the kind of concurrent treatment ; the frequency of treatment ; and the effect desired and can be adjusted by a person skilled in the art . In another embodiment , the compositions according to the present invention can be used for the treatment or prevention of symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin as defined above , as well as for the promotion of hair growth and protection from hair loss . The compositions according to the present invention can further be used for the treatment or prevention of itchy or irritated skin or for fortifying the pigmentation ( the latter , however , only , if no retinoid but a tanning active is present . ) . If retinoid is , however , present in the composition of this invention the composition can be used for the prevention or treatment of pigmentation disorders and/or for providing an even skin tone , since the boosting of retinoids by the fatty acids or a salt , ester or amide thereof as defined above may lead to a depigmentation . Preverably the compositions of the present invention are used for the treatment or prevention of wrinkles or dry skin or sensitive skin , for the promotion of hair growth , for the protection from hair loss , for thickening the epidermis , ( if retinoid is present ) for the prevention or treatment of pigmentation disorders and/or for providing an even skin tone , and/or ( if retinoid is absent and a tanning active is present ) for fortifying the pigmentation . Thus the composition according to the present invention , i .e . the fatty acids or a salt , ester or amide thereof with the definitions and preferences as defined above may fortify the pigmentation by enhancing the effect of a tanning active . While , typically , the cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention contain one of the fatty acids as defined above , the invention is not limited to that particular aspect and two or more fatty acids or a salt , ester or amide thereof as defined above may be present . As stated above , a retinoid may be additionally present , providing an additive or synergistic cosmetic effect , i .e . an improvement or prevention of symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin , as well as promotion of hair growth and protection from hair loss . Again , two or more retinoids may be present . If a retinoid is present in the compositions of the present invention , the ratio of the fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above ) to the retinoid is suitably from about 1000:1 to 1 :1000 , more preferably from about 100:1 to 1 :100 and in particular from about 30 :1 to 1 :30 by weight . The fatty acids or a salt , ester or amide thereof as defined above show also an additive or synergistic effect with retinoids which are already present in the human skin . In the compositions provided by the present invention , the amount of the fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above is suitably from about 0.0001 to about 50 % , preferably from about 0.001 to about 20 % by weight of the total composition . More preferably , the fatty acid as defined above are contained in the composition in an amount of about 0.01 % by weight to about 1 % by weight , most preferably in an amount of about 0.5 % by weight . If a retinoid or derivative thereof is present , the amount of the latter is suitably from about 0.0001 to about 50 % by weight , preferably from about 0.001 to about 20 % by weight , most preferably in an amount of about 0.01 to about 1 weight % , in particular in an amount of about 0.1 % by weight , based on the total amount of the composition . Preferred according to the invention is a composition comprising the fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above in an amount of about 0.5 % by weight and a retinoid or derivative thereof in an amount of about 0.1 % by weight , based on the total amount of the composition . The term " cosmetic composition " as used herein e.g . refers to topical compositions for care of the human skin , see also the heading " Kosmetika " in Rompp Lexikon Chemie , 10th edition 1997 , Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart , New York .

In another embodiment the invention relates to the use of a fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above for boosting the cosmetic effects of retinoids and/or tanning actives . The efficacy of the compositions of the invention comprising fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above , optionally in combination with a retinoid as well as the concept of a synergistic effect between a retinoid and a fatty acid as defined above may be demonstrated in an in vitro test system using human primary keratinocytes as outlined below . The marker may be the enzyme Transglutaminase 1 , which is a well-known and common differentiation marker in human epidermal cells . Epidermal keratinocytes are isolated from human foreskin biopsies and cultured in keratinocyte serum free medium ( KSFM , GIBCO ) in a growth chamber with 37<0>C and 5 % CO2 . At the second passage , cells are transferred to 6 well plates and allowed to reach approximately 50 % surface confluence . The active ingredient( s ) are solubilized in ethanol or ethanol/ tetrahydrofuran . Retinoic acid solutions are handled under yellow light conditions only . When keratinocyte cultures reaches the appropriate confluence , the KSFM medium is supplemented with 1.3 mM calcium , in order to induce keratinocyte differentiation and thus also induce TG1 expression , and treatment is started by adding either a retinoid such as retinoic acid or a fatty acid or a salt , ester or amide with the definitions and preferences as given above or both substances in combination . For every sample , medium and/or treatment substances are changed twice daily . Seventy-two hours after the beginning of the treatment , cells are harvested and the RNA extracted . RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA . Relative quantification of TG1 mRNA transcript levels in control versus treatment cultures are determined using multiplexed real time PCR analysis .

[0001] Novel carboxylic acid derivatives The present invention is concerned with novel arylalkyl carboxylic acid derivatives , more specifically , with acylates of arylalkyl carboxylic acids with naturally occurring , non-toxic hydroxy , sulfhydryl , amino or imino compounds , and to compositions containing them . The compositions are preferably cosmetic preparations . More particularly , the invention is concerned with compounds of the general formula [ Ph-(CH2 )n-CO]m -X ( I ) wherein Ph is phenyl or substituted phenyl , n is 1 or 3 , m is an integer of at least 1 , and X is a moiety from a naturally occurring , non-toxic compound carrying at least one hydroxyl , sulfhydryl , amino or imino group which moiety is formed by removal of a hydrogen atom from said hydroxyl , sulfhydryl , amino or imino group ; except that X is not an amino acid or peptide comprising up to 6 amino acids . The term 'naturally occurring , non-toxic hydroxyl , sulfhydryl , amino or imino compounds ' comprises natural occurring compounds such as vitamins , terpenes , chromanes , flavones , catechols , pyrimidines as well as synthetic derivatives or analogues thereof which have been modified in order to make them susceptible for an attachment to the [ Ph-(CH2 )n-CO]m moiety . It has been found that the compounds provided by the present invention are particularly useful for treating wrinkles but also for thickening the epidermis , repairing the skins lipid barrier , for protection against hair loss and for improving hair growth . Human skin undergoes certain normal cornification processes which give the skin its characteristic appearance . Casual factors or external factors such as a raw climate , wind , photo-damage and irritation triggered by the sun , rain and snow , however , disturb this normal condition of the skin , and there appears a roughness , a formation of scales ( for example on the scalp ) , an excessive keratinization and similar phenomena . Furthermore , in the course of aging of the skin various signs appear that are especially reflected by a change in the structure and function of the skin . One of these signs is the appearance of fine lines and deep wrinkles , the size and number of which increases with age . The micro relief of the skin becomes less uniform and is of anisotropic nature . In parallel with age the skin becomes more sensitive towards disturbing influences , either intrinsic or extrinsic , which may result in itch , redness or even darker spots , particular on hands and the facial area due to pigmentation disorders . These unwanted signs may lead to an undesired age judgment of a person . Cosmetic preparations are essentially useful for skin care . One aim of skin care in the cosmetic sense is to strengthen or rebuild the skin 's natural function as a barrier against environmental influences ( e .g . UV-light , dirt , chemicals , microorganisms ) and against the loss of endogenous substances ( e .g . water , natural lipids , electrolytes ) . If this function becomes impaired , increased resorption of toxic or allergenic substances or attack by microorganisms may result , leading to toxic or allergic skin reactions . Another aim of skin care is to compensate for the loss by the skin of lipids and water caused by daily washing . This is particularly important , if the natural regeneration ability is inadequate . Furthermore , skin care products should protect against environmental influences , in particular against sun and wind , and delay skin aging . Strengthening or thickening of the epidermis together with an optimized skin barrier lipid synthesis can rebuild the skin 's barrier ability and is therefore of significant cosmetic value . Reduced transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) is a sign of an intact lipid barrier , which acts also as first defense line to protect against the appearance of skin wrinkles . Another strategy to fight wrinkles is to stimulate the collagen synthesis in the dermis . A number of degenerative processes act on the collagen matrix and is triggered by extrinsic factors like UV radiation , pollution in general and particular cigarette smoke or intrinsic factors leading to any chronic or sub chronic inflammation . Destruction and/or impaired repair efficacy leads to a denser and less elastic macro structure of the dermis , which in turn leads to the formation of deep wrinkles . Enhancing the de novo synthesis of collagen or other structural proteins of the dermis is considered a valuable therapy to reduce the existing wrinkles and to protect against the appearance of new wrinkles . Of particular importance for anti-aging cosmetics is to inhibit the senescence of skin cells in order to keep their regular metabolic level on a constant and beneficial level . Hair loss or alopecia is a common affliction of humans . The most common form of hair loss in both males and females is patterned baldness or androgenic alopecia . Hair follicles range in size from small , superficial , vellus follicles to large , deep , terminal follicles . The cyclic growth phases of hair follicles are telogen ( resting ) , anagen l-lll ( developing ) , anagen IV-VI ( growing ) and catagen ( involuting ) . In the development of androgenic alopecia there is the gradual diminution of follicle size , with conversion of large , terminal follicles , producing thick , pigmented hair fibers (terminal hair ) to small vellus follicles producing fine , non-pig mented hair fibers (vellus hair ) . In addition , the proportion of growing anagen follicles declines . There exists a wide variety of literature regarding cosmetic preparations , in particular regarding cosmetic preparations for treating wrinkles and for promoting hair growth . As examples of the extensive literature it can be referred e.g . to GB 906,000 , EP-A 699 429 or WO 03/086342 . While a variety of technologies exist to prevent and to fight the signs of skin aging , to improve the appearance of the skin or to treat or prevent hair loss , there is still a demand for more efficacious ingredients . The problem to be solved by the present invention is the provision of novel compounds , of compositions containing these novel compounds , in particular of cosmetic preparations which are particularly useful for treating and/or preventing wrinkles , thickening of the epidermis , and preventing and/or treating of hair loss , but also preparations which are useful against other conditions which are observed with skin aging due to environmental or other external influences or due to age . The new compounds should have an activity which is comparable to the activity of known cosmetically active compounds but preferably is better than the activity of the prior art compounds . This problem is solved on the basis of the unexpected finding that certain arylalkyl carboxylic acylates with naturally occurring , non-toxic hydroxyl , sulfhydryl , amino or imino compounds show activity in cosmetic applications and related pharmaceutical applications , in particular for treating and preventing wrinkles and hair loss and thickening the epidermis , but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin , which may be caused by external or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin . Accordingly , in one aspect , the present invention is concerned with compounds represented by general formula ( I ) as shown above . In another aspect , the invention is concerned with compositions , particularly cosmetic preparations comprising a compound of the formula ( I ) . In still another aspect , the invention is concerned with the use of the compounds of formula ( I ) for treating and preventing wrinkles and hair loss and thickening the epidermis , but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin , which may be caused by external or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin , and with a method of treating and preventing the aforesaid conditions by administering an effective amount of a topical composition comprising a compound of formula ( I ) on the appropriate portions of the skin of an individual in need of such treatment . In another embodiment , the invention relates to a method of treatment or prophylaxis of wrinkles or dry skin or sensitive skin or any symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin , promotion of hair growth , protection from hair loss , a thickening of the epidermis , anti-acne , the inhibition of senescence of skin cells , prevention or treatment of photo damage , prevention or treatment of oxidative stress phenomena , prevention or treatment of cellulite , prevention or treatment of pigmentation disorders and/or even the skin tone , prevention and treatment of disturbances in ceramide and lipid synthesis , prevention of excess sebum production , reduction of activities of matrix metallo proteases or other proteases in the skin , treatment and prevention of inflammatory skin conditions including atopic eczema , polymorphic light eruption , psoriasis , vertiligo , prevention and treatment of itchy or irritated skin , which comprises applying an effective amount of composition comprising a compound of formula ( I ) on the appropriate portions of the skin of the individual in need of such treatment . The term 'an effective amount ' refers to an amount necessary to obtain a physiological effect . The physiological effect may be achieved by one single application or by repeated applications . The dosage applied may , of course , vary depending upon known factors , such as the physiological characteristics of the particular composition and its mode and route of administration ; the age , health and weight of the recipient ; the nature and extent of the symptoms ; the kind of concurrent treatment ; the frequency of treatment ; the concentration of the compound of formula ( I ) in the topical composition ; and the effect desired and can be adjusted by a person skilled in the art . The amount of the topical composition which is to be applied to the skin depends on the concentration of the active ingredients , i .e . the compound of formula ( I ) , in the compositions and the desired cosmetic or pharmaceutical effect . For example , application can be such that a creme is applied to the skin . A creme is usually applied in an amount of 2 mg creme/cm<2> skin . The amount of the composition which is applied to the skin is , however , not critical , and if with a certain amount of applied composition the desired effect cannot be achieved , a higher concentration of the active ingredients can be used e.g . by applying more of the composition or by applying compositions which contain more active ingredient . A preferred group of compounds within the scope of formula ( I ) are those wherein Ph is unsubstituted phenyl . If Ph is substituted phenyl , the phenyl ring may be substituted by up to three substituents which are selected , independently , from hydroxyl , C1-C6 alkyl , C2-C6 alkenyl , C1-C6 alkoxy and C2-C6 alkenyloxy . Preferred substituted phenyl moieties are phenyl mono-substituted by C^-alkoxy , especially methoxyphenyl . In all embodiments of the invention compounds within the scope of formula ( I ) wherein m is 1 are preferred . Most preferred according to the invention are compounds within the scope of formula ( I ) wherein the residue [ Ph-(CH2 )n-CO]m is derived from phenyl butyric acid and m is 1 .

Preferably , the naturally occurring , non-toxic compound carrying at least one hydroxyl , sulfhydryl , amino or imino group from which the moiety X in formula ( I ) is derived is a fat-soluble vitamin or derivative or analogue , in particular a tocopherol , a carotenoid and vitamin D3 or a hydroxyl derivative thereof ; a water-soluble vitamin , derivatives or analogues thereof belonging to the vitamin B or vitamin C group , in particular panthenol , pantothenic acid , pyridoxines , thiamine , riboflavin , nicotinamide , 2-hydroxyethylnicotinamide , folic acid , ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid phosphate , more in particular nicotinamide , 2-hydroxyethylnicotinamide , panthenol , ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid phosphate ; a chromane , flavone , derivatives and analogues thereof , in particular equol , quercetin , delphinidine , silymarin , daidzein , or genistein ; a pyrimidine or purine or analogue thereof , in particular kinetin or allantoin ; a terpene preferably farnesol , bisabolol , phytol and menthol , in particular bisabolol ; or a catechol , in particular epigallocatechingallate . Of particular interest as compounds from which the moiety X is derived , i .e . compounds of the formula XH , are panthenol , bisabolol , kinetin and 2-hydroxyethylnicotinamide . Further examples of compounds of formula ( I ) are the phenyl butyric acid ester of nicotinic acid 2-hydroxyethylamide , glycerol-1-phenylbutyrate-3-nicotinate and the phenyl acetic acid ester of phytanic acid 2-hydroxyethylamide . Especially preferred according to the invention are the following compounds of formula ( I ) : 4-phenylbutyric acid 2-[( pyridine-3-carbonyl )amino]-ethyl ester 4-phenylbutyric acid 3-(2,4-dihydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-butyrylamino)-propyl ester . N-furan-2-yl-methyl-4-phenyl-N-(9H-purin-6-yl)-butyramide 4-phenylbutyric acid 1 ,5-dimethyl-1-(4-methyl-cyclohex-3-enyl)-hex-4-enyl ester . In accordance of the present invention , the compounds of formula ( I ) can be prepared in a manner known per se , e.g . as disclosed in the Examples or in analogy thereto . Generally , the compounds of formula ( I ) can be prepared by acylating a compound of the formula XH , wherein X is as defined above , with a compound of the formula Ph-(CH2 )n-COOH or a reactive derivative thereof . The acylation of the present invention can be carried out in a manner known per se . Suitably , the acylation is carried out using a reactive derivate such as a halogenide , e.g . the chloride or bromide , in the presence of an organic base , e.g . pyridine or an aliphatic amine such as triethylamine , or an inorganic base such as sodium hydride or an alkali carbonate . If required , any groups reactive to the acylating agent which are not intended to be acylated have to be protected . Therefore the acylation of polyfunctional molecules requires versatile protecting groups that can be easily introduced which are orthogonally stable to each other and can be selectively removed under mild conditions . A good selection of the most useful protecting groups for functional and potentially reactive groups which can be easily applied for the above mentioned purpose by people skilled in the art can be found e.g . in P. J. Kocienski , Protecting Groups , 2000 , Corrected Edition , Georg Thieme Verlag , Stuttgart , New York and T. W. Greene , P. G. M. Wuts , Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , 3 Edition , 1999 , John Wiley & Sons , Inc. , New York . For instance , when acylating panthenol , the primary and secondary hydroxy groups located in the carboxylic acid portion of the molecule may be protected by forming an acetonide , thus allowing a selective acylation of the hydroxy group located in the amide portion of the molecule . On the other hand , the acylation of compounds of the formula XH which carry more than one reactive OH , SH , amino or imino group may be carried out without intermediary protection of individual reactive groups , thus leading to compounds of the formula ( I ) wherein m is an integer of greater than 1 with m corresponding to the number of reactive OH , SH , amino or imino groups in the starting compound of formula XH. For the purposes of the present invention , the compounds of formula ( I ) can be used alone or in mixtures . The present invention also provides compositions , in particular topical compositions comprising at least one compound represented by general formula ( I ) , and a cosmetically acceptable excipient or diluent . In case that the compounds of formula I bear one or more chiral centers the compounds represented by general formula ( I ) may be present in a racemic mixture , in a mixture of diastereomers or in excess of an enantiomer and/or diastereomer . If one or more chiral centers are present the optical purity of the mixture is preferably > = 80 % ee , more preferably > 90 % ee , most preferably > 95 % de . If two or more chiral centers are present the purity of the mixture is preferably > = 80 % de , more preferably > = 90 % de , most preferably > = 95 % de .

[0001] ( S)-[omicron]-METHYLOXAALKYL EXEMESTANE COMPOUNDS AND RELATED METHODS OF USE This application claims priority benefit from application serial no . 60/722,204 filed September 30 , 2005 , the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference . Background of the Invention . Abnormal cell proliferation is usually characterized by an increased rate of division and in some cases uncontrolled growth . One example of a proliferative cell disorder is a tumor . In addition to posing a serious health risk in and of themselves , primary malignant tumors are particularly problematic given their tendency to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs in the body . To date , the most frequently used methods for treating neoplasia , especially solid tumor forms of neoplasia , include surgical procedures , radiation therapy , drug therapies , and combinations of the foregoing . Drug therapy for breast cancer may include the administration of exemestane to a patient . Product information available on-line from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration describes exemestane as an irreversible , steroidal aromatase inactivator . Exemestane ( which is sold as Aromasin ( R ) , is chemically described as 6-methylenandrosta-l,4-diene-3,17 -dione . Its molecular formula is C20H24O2 and its structural formula is as follows : [0004 ] EMI2.1 Among other things , exemestane lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women thereby providing a treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer . U.S. Patent Nos . 4,808,616 , and 4,904,650 describe 6-alkylidenandrosta-l,4- diene-3,17-dione derivatives , such as exemestane , and methods of making them . U.S. Patent No. 4,876,045 teaches a method of preparing 6-methylene derivatives of androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-diones by reacting a 17-hydroxy precursor with formaldehyde and an amine , and then oxidizing the resulting compound . U.S. Patent No. 4,990,635 teaches a process for making 6-methylene derivatives of androsta-l,4-diene-3,17 - diones by reacting androsta-3,5-diene-17-one with formaldehyde and an amine , and then dehydrogenating the resulting compound . The preparation of intermediates that may be useful in preparing exemestane is also described in the literature . In U.S. Patent No. 3,274,176 , there is described a process for making l,3-dipyrrolidyl-[Delta]3 ,5-androstadiene-17-one in which [ Delta]l ,4- androstadiene-3,17-dione is refluxed with pyrrolidine and the residue is crystallized in methanol to obtain l,3-dipyrrolidyl-[Delta]3 ,5-androstadiene-17-one . In German patent DD 258820 , 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione is prepared from androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione via l,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-dien-17-one . A solution of l,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-dien-17-one in benzene-ethanol is stirred with aqueous formaldehyde ( HCHO ) until the reaction is complete . Co-pending international application no . PCT/US2005/001248 filed January 14 , 2005 (PCT Publication Number WO 2005/070951 ) also describes the preparation of intermediates that are useful in preparing exemestane , such application as is incorporated herein by reference , in its entirety . The clinical pharmacology in this exemestane product information states that the mechanism of action for breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent . Aromatase is described as the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre - and postmenopausal women . It is reported that the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens ( androstenedione and testosterone ) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol ) by the aromatese enzyme . Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is described as an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer . Exemestane as an irreversible , steroidal aromatase inactivator is believed to act as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme , and processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation . Exemestane lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women thereby providing a treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer . However , a need still exists to identify new and effective agents for treating cancer . Summary of the Invention .

In one aspect , this invention provides a method for inhibiting growth of cells of a cancer or a tumor . In such a method , the cells are exposed to or contacted with a compound of Formula ( A ) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof : [0027] EMI9.1 wherein each Of R1 , R2 , R3 , and R4 , independently , is hydrogen , halogen or alkyl , and R5 is alkyl . One specific non-limiting example compound of Formula ( A ) has the Formula ( B ) below : [0030] EMI9.2 O More specifically , showing various stereochemical relationships , such a compound B can be represented as [0033] EMI10.1 The compound of Formula ( B ) can be referred to as "6S" or " Exemestane 6S" . Looking at Figure I5 the compound of formula ( B ) can be prepared by first preparing l,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one ( EX-I) from ( +)-androsta-l , A- diene-3 , 17-dione ( ADD) . One set of conditions utilizes ( +)-androsta-l,4-diene-3 , 17 - dione ( ADD) , 12.2 equivalents pyrrolidine , catalytic acetic acid , denatured ethanol ( 95/5 ethanol/methanol ) and 6-7 % tetrahydrofuran (volume basis of total volume of ethanol and pyrrolidine ) with heating to 30-40<0>C for a minimum of 16 hours . Once the ADD content is less than 3 % by HPLC area , becomes static or EX-I begins to revert to ADD , the reaction mixture is cooled to 5 + - 5[deg.]C , collected and washed with cold denatured ethanol . Yields are typically 70 - 80 % on a dry basis with purities typically 90 - 95 % by HPLC area percent . Next , 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3 , 17-dione ( EX-2 ) is prepared from l,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-355-diene-17-one ( EX-I) . One set of conditions for the preparation employ 1 equivalent l,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one ( EX-I) and 2.6 equivalents formalin ( formaldehyde ) in 10 mL dichloromethane/g of EX-I at room temperature . Workup consists of acidification of the reaction mixture to a pH of about 2 , dilution with 2 % sulfuric acid ( aqueous , volume/volume basis ) and removal of the organic layer which is then washed with 2 % sulfuric acid (vol/vol ) and 1 : 1 water/brine . Solvent exchange into toluene ( approximately 10 mL/g theory EX-2 ) is then carried out and the product crystallizes as toluene exchange transpires . The product is collected , washed and dried to provide 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta - 1 ,A- diene-3 , 17-dione ( EX-2 ) in yields of typically 75 - 80 % . Purity is usually 96 % or greater by HPLC area percent . Next , the 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17 - dione ( EX-2 ) may be treated as shown in Figure 1 to prepare the 6S compound , which is Formula ( B ) above . In another aspect of such a method the cells are exposed to a compound of Formula ( C ) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof : [0037] EMI11.1 wherein each OfR1 , R2 , R3 , R4 , independently , is hydrogen , halogen or alkyl , and R5 is alkyl . One specific non-limiting example compound of Formula ( C ) has the Formula ( D) below : [0040] EMI11.2 More specifically showing various stereochemical relationships , such a compound D can be represented as [0042] EMI12.1 The compound of Formula ( D) can be referred to as "6R " or " Exemestane 6R" . Looking at Figure 2 , the compound of formula ( D) can be prepared by reacting 6- hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione ( EX-2 ) as shown in Figure 2 to produce exemestane and then reacting the exemestane as shown in Figure 2 to produce the 6R compound , which is Formula ( D) above . To treat an individual/subject , an effective amount of one or more of the present compounds , or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof , is administered so as to be exposed to or contact cancer cells or a tumor .

Regardless of the route of administration selected , the active ingredient( s ) are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art . The amount of the active ingredient( s ) which will be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated , the particular mode of administration and all of the other factors described above . The amount of the active ingredient( s ) which will be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the active ingredient( s ) which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect . Methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations or compositions include the step of bringing the active ingredient( s ) into association with the carrier and , optionally , one or more accessory ingredients . In general , the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient( s ) into association with liquid carriers , or finely divided solid carriers , or both , and then , if necessary , shaping the product .

Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient( s ) moistened with an inert liquid diluent . The tablets , and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention , such as dragees , capsules , pills and granules , may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells , such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art . They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient( s ) therein using , for example , hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile , other polymer matrices , liposomes and/or microspheres . They may be sterilized by , for example , filtration through a bacteria - retaining filter .

Besides inert diluents , the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents , emulsifying and suspending agents , sweetening , flavoring , coloring , perfuming and preservative agents . Suspensions , in addition to the active ingredient( s ) , may contain suspending agents as , for example , ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols , polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters , microcrystalline cellulose , aluminum metahydroxide , bentonite , agar-agar and tragacanth , and mixtures thereof . Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository , which may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient( s ) with one or more suitable nonin[iota]tating excipients or carriers comprising , for example , cocoa butter , polyethylene glycol , a suppository wax or salicylate and which is solid at room temperature , but liquid at body temperature and , therefore , will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient( s ) . Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries , tampons , creams , gels , pastes , foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate . Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of the active ingredient( s ) include powders , sprays , ointments , pastes , creams , lotions , gels , solutions , patches and inhalants . The active ingredient( s ) may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier , and with any buffers , or propellants which may be required . The ointments , pastes , creams and gels may contain , in addition to the active ingredient( s ) , excipients , such as animal and vegetable fats , oils , waxes , paraffins , starch , tragacanth , cellulose derivatives , polyethylene glycols , silicones , bentonites , silicic acid , talc and zinc oxide , or mixtures thereof . Powders and sprays can contain , in addition to the active ingredient( s ) , excipients such as lactose , talc , silicic acid , aluminum hydroxide , calcium silicates and polyamide powder , or mixtures of these substances . Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons , such as butane and propane . Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of the active ingredient( s ) to the body . Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving , dispersing or otherwise incorporating the active ingredient( s ) in a proper medium , such as an elastomeric matrix material . Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the active ingredient( s ) across the skin . The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate-controlling membrane or dispersing the active ingredient( s ) in a polymer matrix or gel . Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient( s ) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions , dispersions , suspensions or emulsions , or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use , which may contain antioxidants , buffers , solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents . Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water , ethanol , polyols ( such as glycerol , propylene glycol , polyethylene glycol , and the like ) , and suitable mixtures thereof , vegetable oils , such as olive oil , and injectable organic esters , such as ethyl oleate . Proper fluidity can be maintained , for example , by the use of coating materials , such as lecithin , by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions , and by the use of surfactants . These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as wetting agents , emulsifying agents and dispersing agents . It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents , such as sugars , sodium chloride , and the like in the compositions . In addition , prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin . In some cases , in order to prolong the effect of the active ingredient( s ) , it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drag from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection . This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility . The rate of absorption of the active ingredient( s ) then depends upon its/their rate of dissolution which , in turn , may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form . Alternatively , delayed absorption of parenterally-administered active ingredient( s ) is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the active ingredient( s ) in an oil vehicle . Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the active ingredient( s ) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide . Depending on the ratio of the active ingredient( s ) to polymer , and the nature of the particular polymer employed , the rate of release of the active ingredient( s ) can be controlled . Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters ) and poly(anhydrides ) . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the active ingredient( s ) in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue . The injectable materials can be sterilized for example , by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter . The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers , for example , ampoules and vials , and may be stored in a lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier , for example water for injection , immediately prior to use . Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions maybe prepared from sterile powders , granules and tablets of the type described above . The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be used in the form of veterinary formulations , including those adapted for the following : ( 1 ) oral administration , for example , drenches ( aqueous or nonaqueous solutions or suspensions ) , tablets , boluses , powders , granules or pellets for admixture with feed stuffs , pastes for application to the tongue ; ( 2 ) parenteral administration , for example , by subcutaneous , intramuscular or intravenous injection as , for example , a sterile solution or suspension or , when appropriate , by intramammary injection where a suspension or solution is introduced into the udder of the animal via its teat ; ( 3 ) topical application , for example , as a cream , ointment or spray applied to the skin ; or ( 4 ) intravaginally , for example , as a pessary , cream or foam . Examples of the Invention . The following non-limiting examples and data illustrate various aspects and features relating to the compounds , compositions and/or methods of the present invention , including the use of a range of methyl oxaaklyl derivatives of exemestane , as are available through the synthetic methodologies described herein .

While the utility of this invention is illustrated through the use of several compounds and moieties incorporated therein , it will understood be those skilled in the art that comparable results are obtainable with various other compounds , compositions and related methods , as are commensurate with the scope of this invention . Example 1 Activity Of 6-Methyloxamethyl Exemestane Compounds Against Cancer Cell Lines . Cancer-derived cell lines were used for the following growth inhibition assay . The ability of the compound of Formula ( B ) above and the compound of Formula ( D) above to inhibit cancer-derived cell growth was compared to exemestane as a control . Cell viability is determined using the MTS assay . This colorimetric procedure measures conversion of the MTS reagent ( a tetrazoleum salt ) to formazan by living cells . Formazan production is quantified by spectrophotometric measurement at 490 nm and is proportional to viable cell number . Cells are cultured and treated . Following treatment , 100 [mu]l of growth medium is removed and cells incubated with 20[mu]l CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent ( 1.9 mg/ml in PBS , pH 6.0) for 1-3 hours at 37[deg.]C. Absorbance ( OD ) values are measured using a [mu] Quant microplate reader at a single wavelength of 490 nm . The data were measured as the 50 % inhibitory dose ( IC50 ) and are reported in Table 1 below . Table 1 [0063] EMI19.1 All data represent the mean of 2 independent trials . Additional assays were performed to evaluate the growth-inhibiting activity of the compound of Formula ( B ) above and the compound of Formula ( D) compared to exemestane as a control . The percent of cell growth inhibited at a dose of 200 [mu]M is reported in Table 2 below . Table 2 [0066] EMI20.1 Table 3 below provides the cell line information . Table 3 [0069] EMI21.1 The compound of Formula ( B ) ( 6S ) demonstrates excellent activity against a variety of cancer cell lines ( 95-98 % inhibition - see Table 2 ) . By comparison , the exemestane ( control ) shows marginal activity against the same cell lines . In addition , under the conditions and protocols employed , the data consistently shows that Formula ( B ) ( exemestane 6S ) works best against cell lines that are estrogen(-) and/or aromatase ( + ) , as compared to cell lines that are estrogen ( + ) and aromatase (-) .

[0001] AMINO ACID-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS AND DERIVATIVES LABELED WITH HALIDES AND METHOD OF MAKING BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to amino acid-containing compounds and their derivatives labeled with one or more halogen atoms and to methods of making such labeled amino acid-containing compounds and derivatives . The growing need for the early diagnosis and assessment and/or treatment of diseases can potentially be addressed by pharmaceuticals that preferentially accumulate at the disease sites . In diagnostic applications , these pharmaceuticals can elucidate the state of the disease through its distinctive biology expressed as disease markers that are not present , or are present in diminished levels , in healthy tissues . In therapeutic applications , these pharmaceuticals can deliver an enhanced dose of therapeutic agents to the disease sites through specific interactions with the disease markers . By specifically targeting physiological or cellular functions that are present only in disease states , these pharmaceuticals can report exclusively on the scope and progress of that disease or exclusively target the diseased tissue . A signal-generating moiety is a key element of these diagnostic pharmaceuticals , which produce differentiated signals at the disease sites . In certain situations , these pharmaceuticals are based on peptides or derivatives thereof that bind specifically to disease markers . The peptides or derivatives thereof are labeled with moieties that generate a signal that can be detected by imaging equipment for the purposes of disease diagnosis . Alternatively , the moieties can comprise a radioisotope for the purposes of disease therapy . Positron emission tomography ( "PET" ) has gained acceptance as a technique for diagnostic imaging because of its capability of providing images with high resolution in addition to its non-invasive nature . In PET , gamma photons having 511 keV energy produced during positron annihilation decay are detected . In the clinical setting , fluorine-18 (F-18 ) is one of the most widely used positron-emitting nuclides . However , its relatively short half life of 1 10 minutes has limited or precluded its use with constructs ( such as antibodies , antibody fragments , or receptor-targeted peptides ) that would require relatively long time to accumulate sufficiently at the target . Furthermore , the relatively short half life of F-18 would necessitate the manufacture of the F-18-labeled pharmaceutical immediately before its use and a short time required for such manufacture . However , these requirements are inconsistent with the currently known complicated chemistry that is required to link inorganic fluoride species to such organic targeting vectors . Therefore , a continued need exists for a rapid method of labeling peptides and their derivatives with short-lived radioisotopes . In particular , it is very desirable to provide a rapid method for labeling peptides and their derivatives with short-lived halogen radioisotopes . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method of labeling an amino acid-containing compound or a derivative thereof with a halide moiety .

Alternatively , the amino acid-containing compound or a derivative thereof can preferentially accumulate at a disease site by binding to an enzyme overproduced by the diseased tissue . Thus , the radioactive halide-labeled amino acid-containing compound carries the radioactive halide label with it to the disease site , which can then be imaged by detecting and measuring the differentiated level of radioactivity . Alternatively , the radioactive halide-labeled amino acid - containing compound or a derivative thereof can have a therapeutic effect when the emitted radiation can kill the surrounding diseased tissue or otherwise stop its growth .

In one preferred embodiment , the halogenated electrophilic compound is N-fluoro- 2,6-dichloro pyridinium triflate . EXAMPLE : Direct Labeling of Peptide With Halogen Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis First , the solid-phase synthesis technique was employed for the production of two peptide sequences , each having a nucleophilic moiety . The peptides sequences were JiFLGFL-NH2 and J2FLGFL-NH2 , wherein Jj is 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl glycine and J2 is 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propionic acid . The syntheses of both sequences were equally successful , although the absence of the amino group in J2 makes it usable as a terminus only . On the other hand , Ji could be inserted anywhere along the peptide chain . For these model compounds , the sequence was chosen to be chemically non - reactive and with high organic solubility . The J2 peptide was synthesized to evaluate relative reactivity in comparison to the Ji series and to gauge whether J2 and Ji moieties could be used within the same peptide sequence . Peptides were synthesized using standard solid phase techniques with TV^-Fmoc - protected amino acids ( see ; e.g. , W. C. Chan and P.D. White (ed . ) , " Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis , " pp . 9-40 , Oxford University Press , New York , New York ( 2000 ) ) using 2,4-dimethoxybenzhydrylamine resin ( Rink Amide AM ) on a 25 Dmole scale ( Fmoc = fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl ) . The peptides were synthesized using a Rainin/Protein Technology Symphony solid phase peptide synthesizer ( Woburn , MA ) . Prior to any chemistry , the resin was swelled for one hour in methylene chloride , and subsequently exchanged out with DMF ( dimethylformamide ) over half - hour or more . Each coupling reaction was carried out at room temperature in DMF with five equivalents of amino acid . Reaction times were typically 45 minutes . The coupling reagent used was HBTU ( C>-benzotriazolyl-l-yl-./V , ./VyvyV' - tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate ) , with NMM (N-methylmorpholine ) as the base . For each step the coupling agent was delivered at a scale of five equivalents relative to the estimated resin capacity , and reaction carried out in 2.5 ml of 0.4 M NMM solution in DMF. Following each coupling reaction , the N-terminal Fmoc-protected amine was deprotected by applying 20 % piperidine in DMF twice at room temperature for approximately 15 minutes . After the addition of the last residue the resin , still on the peptide synthesizer , was rinsed thoroughly with DMF and methylene chloride . To couple the Ji or J2 to the N-terminus of the peptide , the amino acid , HBTU and NMM was added to the resin in the same manner as the amino acids . The reaction typically proceeded for 3 hours , at the end of which period the Fmoc Group was removed for Xj . After the reaction , the N-terminal amine group of the peptide was capped with an acyl group by adding 0.05 M acetic anhydride , 0.2 M NM and 0.05 M HBTU in a total volume of 2.5 ml DMF. Post reaction , the resin was thoroughly washed with DMF and methylene chloride and dried under a stream of nitrogen . Peptide Fluorination A parallel fluorination setup was employed in order to ensure similar reaction conditions for all the individual peptide compositions within each fluorination experiment . This was accomplished using an array of Teflon tubes fritted at the bottom , arranged such that simultaneous addition of a reagent or solvent can be achieved from the top , while simultaneous removal of liquid can be made by applying vacuum below the frit . Each fluorination tube was loaded with resin beads containing one of the peptide to be fluorinated , amounting to 6 [mu]mol peptide/tube ( 8.2 +/ - 0.1 mg beads/tube ) . The tubes were kept in a high vacuum desiccator overnight . Prior to fluorination , the resins were swelled for 1 hr . by adding 0.25 ml dry dichloromethane . A 0.1 M solution of N-fluoro-2,6-dichloropyridinium triflate( 40 ) in dry acetonitrile was prepared prior to use . The dichloromethane solvent used for swelling was drawn off , replaced with fresh dry solvent ( 0.25 ml/tube ) and to each tube were added 130 [mu]l of the fluorinating solution ( 1.1 equivalents vs. peptide , corrected for the electron-rich Rink resin linker ) . Upon a contact time of 15 minutes , the liquids were drawn off , the beads were washed with fresh dichloromethane and the resin was submitted to the cleavage protocol . Fluorinated Peptide Cleavage From Resin To cleave the peptides from the resin a cocktail consisting of 1 ml TFA ( trifluoacetic acid ) , 2.5 % TIS ( triisopropylsilane ) and 2.5 % water was used . The resin and cocktail were stirred at room temperature for approximately 3 to 4 hours . The resin beads were filtered off using glass wool , followed by rinsing with 2-3 ml of TFA. The peptide was precipitated with 40 ml of ice-cold ether and centrifuged at 3000-4000 rpm until the precipitate formed a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube . The ether was decanted , and the pellet was resuspended in cold ether ( 40 ml ) and centrifuged again ; the process was repeated two to three times . During the final wash 10 ml of Millipore water was added to 30 ml of cold ether , and the mixture was centrifuged again . The ether was decanted . The aqueous layer , containing the crude peptide , was transferred to a round bottom flask for lyophilization . Mass Spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF ) Characterization Peptide molecular weight , and hence fluorination , were analyzed using Time of Flight MALDI mass spectrometry in the reflectron mode ( Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR , Framingham , MA ) . Mass Spectrometry confirmed that both series of compounds , JiFLGFL-NH2 and J2FLGFL-NH2 , were successfully fluorinated . Although the degree of fluorination was not quantified , the predominant peak in the MALDI spectra was that of the fluorinated species . Figure 1 shows the mass spectrum ( MALDI-TOF ) of JiFLGFL - NH2 , wherein J] is 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl glycine . The expected molecular weight of about 894 is seen in the spectrum . Figure 2 shows the mass spectrum ( MALDI-TOF ) of J2FLGFL-NH2 , wherein J2 is 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propionic acid . The expected molecular weight of about 836 is seen in the spectrum . Carboxyl hypofluorites are another suitable class of halogenated electrophilic compounds when the desired halogen is fluorine . Carboxyl hypofluorites can be generated in-situ by the method described in S. Rozen et al . , " Acetyl Hypofluorite , the First Member of a New Family of Organic Compounds , " J. C. S. Chem . Comm. , pp . 443-44 ( 1981 ) . For example , in one non-limiting experiment demonstrating the use of a hypofluorite to fluorinate a peptide , the procedure was as follows . Resin beads on which a peptide was synthesiezed ( at a loading of 0.45 micromoles of peptide/mg of beads ) were swollen in fluorotrichloromethane ( Freon-11 ) for 2 hours at 0 C prior to fiuorination . To a Teflon vial with cap and a teflon lined septum was added a 9/1 v/v mixture of Freon-1 1 /acetic acid ( 0.44 ml/micromole of peptide ) , and the mixture was cooled to -78C with a dry ice-acetone mixture . A gaseous mixture of 1 % ( v/v ) F2 in N2 was bubbled through ( 1 ml/ micromole peptide ) , and then the slurry was sparged with N2 . A capillary passed through a syringe needle was used both for dilute F2 addition and for the N2 sparging . To this mixture was quickly added a suspension of the beads containing the peptide in Freon-11 via canula . The mixture was stirred at -78C for 5 minutes , then the solvent was drawn off and the beads were washed with dichloromethane . Typically , the reaction was conducted on 7 -16 mg of resin-bound peptide ( 3.15 - 7.2 micromoles peptide ) with the reagent ratios sateted above . Cleavage of the fluorinated peptide was performed as in the example disclosed above , and fiuorination was confirmed by MALDI-TOF. Thus , the method of the present invention can be used rapidly and conveniently to produce a radioactive halide labeled amino acid-containing compound . For example , an amino acid-containing compound can be labeled with a short-lived radioactive halogen , such as F , only a short time before the labeled compound is to be used to avoid a substantial decay of the radioactive level , from which other methods typically suffer . Similarly , an amino acid-containing compound or a derivative thereof can be labeled with a halogen other than fluorine . Moreover , the procedure of the present invention , as disclosed above , is equally applicable to a radioactive halogen such as any of the radioisotope of fluorine , chlorine , bromine , or iodine disclosed above . In general , an amino acid-containing compound or a derivative thereof that can be labeled with the method of the present invention comprises at least one amino acid residue in a backbone chain . For example , such an amino acid-containing compound can be a protein or a fragment thereof . Further , such a protein or fragment thereof labeled with a radioactive halogen can be targeted to disease site when such protein preferentially binds a marker substance that is produced by or associated with the diseased tissue . Thus , a labeled protein or fragment thereof produced according to the method of the present invention can serve as a diagnostic imaging or therapeutic agent . The amino acid-containing compound may also be replaced by a peptide nucleic acid ( "PNA" ) . PNAs are oligomers , the backbone chains of which comprise repeating units of N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine , wherein the amino nitrogen of the glycine moiety is linked to one of five heterocyclic bases (adenine , guanine , cytosine , thymine , and uracil ) through a methyl carbonyl linkage . See ; e.g. , U.S. patent 6,395,474 . In still another embodiment , the amino-acid containing compound comprises at least one amino-acid residue and at least a residue of at least another type of monomelic units in the backbone chain , wherein the nucleophilic moiety is conjugated to the at least one amino-acid residue . For example , the at least another type of monomeric units can comprise a chain of plurality of nucleotides ( "oligonucleotides " ) or derivatives thereof having an amine functional group at a terminus . In one embodiment , the at least one amino-acid residue is attached to the terminal amine group of the chain of nucleotides or derivatives thereof . In one embodiment , when the radioactive halogen is capable of emitting positrons , the labeled compound is used to image a portion of the body using positron emission tomography ( "PET" ) . In an embodiment , the proteins of interest in the present invention are antibodies and antibody fragments . The terms "antibodies " and "antibody fragments " mean generally immunoglobulins or fragments thereof that specifically bind to antigens to form immune complexes . The antibody may be a whole immunoglobulin of any class ; e.g. , IgG , IgM , IgA , IgD , IgE , chimeric or hybrid antibodies with dual or multiple antigen or epitope specificities . It can be a polyclonal antibody , preferably an affinity-purified antibody from a human . It can be an antibody from an appropriate animal ; e.g. , a primate , goat , rabbit , mouse , or the like . If the target site-binding region is obtained from a non - human species , it is preferred that the target species is humanized to reduce immunogenicity of the non-human antibodies , for use in human diagnostic or therapeutic applications . Such a humanized antibody or fragment thereof is also termed " chimeric . " For example , a chimeric antibody comprises non-human ( such as murine ) variable regions and human constant regions . A chimeric antibody fragment can comprise a variable binding sequence or complementarity-determining regions ( "CDR" ) derived from a non-human antibody within a human variable region framework domain . Monoclonal antibodies are also suitable for use in the present invention , and are preferred because of their high specificities . They are readily prepared by what are now considered conventional procedures of immunization of mammals with an immunogenic antigen preparation , fusion of immune lymph or spleen cells with an immortal myeloma cell line , and isolation of specific hybridoma clones . More unconventional methods of preparing monoclonal antibodies are not excluded , such as interspecies fusions and genetic engineering manipulations of hypervariable regions , since it is primarily the antigen specificity of the antibodies that affects their utility in the present invention . It will be appreciated that newer techniques for production of monoclonal antibodies ( "MAb" ) can also be used ; e.g. , human MAbs , interspecies MAbs , chimeric ( e .g. , human/mouse ) MAbs , genetically engineered antibodies , and the like . Antibody fragments useful in the present invention include F(ab')2 , F(ab)2 , Fab' , Fab , Fv , and the like including hybrid fragments . Preferred fragments are Fab' , F(ab')2 , Fab , and F(ab)2 . Also useful are any subfragments retaining the hypervariable , antigen-binding region of an immunoglobulin and having a size similar to or smaller than a Fab ' fragment . An antibody fragment can include genetically engineered and/or recombinant proteins , whether single-chain or multiple-chain , which incorporate an antigen-binding site and otherwise function in vivo as targeting species in substantially the same way as natural immunoglobulin fragments . Such single - chain binding molecules are disclosed in U.S. Pat . No. 4,946,778 . Fab ' antibody fragments may be conveniently made by reductive cleavage of F(ab')2 fragments , ' which themselves may be made by pepsin digestion of intact immunoglobulin . Fab antibody fragments may be made by papain digestion of intact immunoglobulin , under reducing conditions , or by cleavage of F(ab)2 fragments which result from careful papain digestion of whole immunoglobulin . The fragments may also be produced by genetic engineering . It should be noted that mixtures of antibodies and immunoglobulin classes can be used , as can hybrid antibodies . Multispecific , including bispecific and hybrid , antibodies and antibody fragments are sometimes desirable in the present invention for detecting and treating lesions and comprise at least two different substantially monospecific antibodies or antibody fragments , wherein at least two of said antibodies or antibody fragments specifically bind to at least two different antigens produced or associated with the targeted lesion or at least two different epitopes or molecules of a marker substance produced or associated with the targeted lesion . Multispecific antibodies and antibody fragments with dual specificities can be prepared analogously to the anti-tumor marker hybrids disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,361 ,544 . Other techniques for preparing hybrid antibodies are disclosed in ; e.g. , U.S. Patents 4,474,893 and 4,479,895 , and in Milstein et al . , Immunology Today , Vol . 5 , 299 ( 1984 ) . In another aspect , the present invention provides a set of separate compounds comprising a first compound comprising an amino acid-containing compound , such as a peptide or peptide derivative , that comprises a nucleophilic moiety , and a second compound that is electrophilic and comprises a halide moiety . The compounds readily react with one another to produce a halide-labeled peptide or peptide derivative , which is produced substantially at the time of use .

[0001] Glucosaminylmuramic acid derivatives Technical field of the invention The invention deals with glucosaminylmuramic acid (2-amino-2-deoxy-[beta]-D-gluco - pyranosyl-(l->4)-iV-acetylmuramic acid ) derivatives , method of their synthesis , and their use for the synthesis of glucosaminylmuramyl glycopeptides , i .e . disaccharide analogues of muramyl glycopeptides . Background of the invention Immunopharmaceutics represent a new group of drugs that already have an irreplaceable role in modern clinical practice . Disorders of the organism immune capacity due to negative changes in the environment , an increased occurrence of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to antibiotics , and infections damaged immunity ( e .g . AIDS ) as well as a frequent application of immunosuppressive therapeutic procedures such as radio - and chemotherapy of tumor diseases , just as following transplantations , present a serious medical problem . The present tendency to replace live vaccines by safer semi-synthetic , recombinant , and synthetic ones requires new structurally defined adjuvants . Therefore , considerable attention is devoted to the development of substances with immunostimulatory activity with the aim to obtain a ) safe , structurally defined adjuvants for protein , peptide and DNA vaccines , b ) stimulators of nonspecific antiinfectious and antitumor immunity , and c ) stimulators of hemopoiesis . Important representatives of such compounds are muramyl glycopeptides that are derived from peptidoglycan fragments of bacterial cell wall , i .e . compounds derived from the minimal immunoadjuvant unit , "muramyl dipeptide " ( MDP ) , and basic repeating disaccharide-dipeptide unit , "glucosaminyl-muramyl-dipeptide " ( GMDP ) . During the past three decades many analogues of MDP and GMDP were synthesized in order to increase the specificity of therapeutic activity and to suppress undesired side effects , especially pyrogenicity . This effort led to compounds interesting for pharmaceutical industry ( for review see ref . ) . From MDP derived compounds , therapeutic Romurtid( TM) ( MDP-Lys-L-18 ) , based on MDP molecule prolonged in the peptide part by Lys substituted with stearoyl residue , is in the most progressed phase of development . Romurtid( TM) is less pyrogenic than MDP and successfully passed clinical trials . Principal practical application is stimulation of hemopoiesis in patients after radiotherapy or chemotherapy<3"5> . Acceleration of neutrophil number normalization in periphery blood is important in order to suppress the risk of infection in immunosuppressed patients<6 >'<7> . Romurtid( TM) is also able to increase natural immunity against viral<8> and bacterial<9 > '<10> infections and tumor growth<11> . GMDP , in comparison with MDP , has higher immunoadjuvant activity and lower pyrogenicity . Hence , the compounds derived from GMDP are more perspective potential immunotherapeutics than compounds derived from MDP<2> . GMDP-based compound Likopid( TM) is the first immunotherapeutic of the muramyl glycopeptide type introduced to the clinical practice . Likopid( TM) was developed and registered by a Russian company Peptek as an immunotherapeutic with broad applicability , e.g . immunostimulation and prevention of infections complicating post-traumatic , post-operative , post-chemotherapeutic and post- radiotherapeutic patienthood<12> . Other areas are treatment of infectious diseases , as tuberculosis , human cervical papilomavirus , ophthalmic herpetic infections , psoriasis and treatment of ulcerous and inflammation processes . Likopid( TM) can be used alone or in combination with antibiotics and antivirotics<13> for treatment of infectious diseases . Side effects are associated with pyrogenicity that stems from the active component GMDP. Company ImmunoTherapeutics , Inc. , North Dacota , USA , is developing lipophilic analogues of GMDP , e.g . "disaccharidetripeptide-glyceroldipalmitate " (DTP-GDP ) , modified in the carboxy-terminal part by glycerol-dipalmitate residue , and structurally related GMTP- N-DPG , modified in the carboxy-terminal part of the peptide chain by dipalmitoylpropylarnide residue . DTP-GDP was proposed as potential immunotherapeutic of tumor diseases<14> . The compound applied in liposomes is active in the therapy of liver tumors metastases <5> . DTP-GDP passed successfully phase II of clinical trials , but is strongly pyrogenic<15> . Its main side effects , besides pyrogenicity , are shivers , nausea and hypotension . GMTP-N-DPG is a perspective adjuvans for cellular immunity usable for construction of new generation vaccines against some serious infectious diseases ( AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria )<16>'<17> . Some of the above mentioned analogues are part of produced adjuvants . As examples can be given Gerbu Adjuvant( TM) , containing GMDP (CC Biotech Corporation , USA ) , ImmTher( TM) , containing DTP-GDP5 and Theramide ( TM) , containing DTP-DPP ( GMTP-N- DPG) ( ImmunoTherapeutics , USA ) ; ref .<18> . The accessibility of the carbohydrate component is the main problem in the synthesis of GMDP-derived murarnyl glycopeptides . The synthesis of oligosaccharides represents a challenging task , especially as for the sequences containing D-glucose units connected with [beta](l->4 ) glycosidic bond due to a low reactivity of the OH( 4 ) group<19"23> . Known synthetic approaches of disaccharide GMDP component represent a challenging process due to many synthetic steps and associated low affectivity . These syntheses can be divided into three groups ( according to the glycosyl acceptor used for glycosylation reaction representing a key step in disaccharide unit synthesis ) : a ) glycosylation with acyclic precursor of muramic acid<24>'<25> , b ) glycosylation with cyclic precursor of muramic acid<26"28> , and c ) glycosylation with cyclic derivative of muramic acid<29"33> . Therefore semisynthetic , in addition to de novo synthetic , approach is applied in the field of GMDP and its analogues synthesis , too . The sugar component preparation is based on a biotechnological process of preparation of bacterial mass by fermentation , by partial enzymatic hydrolysis of bacterial walls and difficult isolation of disaccharide unit by chromatographic techniques . The obtained 2-acetamido-2- deoxy-[beta]-D-glucopyranosyl(l->4)N-acetylmuramic acid ( [beta]-D-Glc[Nu]Ac(l->4)Mur[Nu]Ac ) is then condensed with the peptide component<17>'<34"36> . The semisynthetic approach is applied as by a Russian company Peptek for the preparation of the active component of Likopid( TM) ( GMDP ) and by ImmunoTherapeutics , Inc. , USA , for preparation of GMDP analogues (DTP-GDP and GMTP-N-DPG) modified in carboxy terminal part of the peptide chain by lipophilic residue . In spite of illusive simple semisynthetic approach , their disadvantages are poor reproducibility and necessity of standardization of the biotechnological production process of disaccharide component . At the same time , reproducibility and standardization of production processes are the main criteria for the production of drugs and their substances . A limiting factor for introduction of GMDP-based therapeutics into the practice is complicated accessibility of the disaccharide component , 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-[beta]-D- glucopyranosyl(l->4)iV-acetylmuraniic acid ( [beta]-D-GlcNAc(l-"4)MurNAc ) , and their derivatives , respectively . Present invention solves this problem by elaboration of effective synthesis of disaccharide synthon enabling reasonable synthesis of GMDP-based muramyl glycopeptides as well as 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-[beta]-D-glucopyranosyl(l->4)N-acetylmuramic acid itself .

[0001] PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF DULOXETINE Field of the invention The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1-naphthol mixed ethers , in particular of duloxetine Ia : [0004 ] EMI2.1 1a Background of the invention The preparation of 1-naphthol mixed ethers raises remarkable interest , since it regards , for example , the synthesis of duloxetine Ia ( ( +)-(S)-N- methyl-[gamma]-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine ) , whose hydrochloride salt is used as antidepressant . EP 273 658 discloses two methods for the preparation of duloxetine or of its precursor Ib : [0008 ] EMI2.2 1b A first procedure comprises the use of 1-naphthol 3a [0011] EMI2.3 3a and of compounds of formula 2. [0013] EMI3.1 2 in particular compound 2a in which X = N( CH3)2 . The ether bond in compounds Ia and Ib forms through Mitsunobu reaction , which consists in the treatment in a ether solvent , for example tetrahydrofuran , of compounds 3a and 2 with equimolecular amounts of triphenylphosphine and of an azodicarboxylic acid ester (typically the diisopropyl ester ) . In this way the ether bond forms with inversion of configuration , obtaining as by-products equimolecular amounts of triphenylphosphine oxide and diisopropyl hydrazodicarboxylate , whose separation from the desired ether is troublesome . The X substituent in compounds 2 can be , further to -N( CH3)2 , any good leaving group susceptible of being substituted with a nitrogen function which allows to obtain ( +) - duloxetine Ia . The Mitsunobu reaction with compound 2a proceeds in more than 24 h . The equimolar ratio of the two reagents ( triphenylphosphine and azodicarboxylate ) with respect to compounds 2 and 3a and the prolonged reaction times make this synthetic procedure not very profitable , even if it proceeds with inversion of configuration at the oxygen-bearing carbon in compounds 2. A method for the synthesis of duloxetine Ia that is preferred to the one reported above envisages the use of 1-fluoronaphthalene 3b [0017] EMI3.2 3b and 2a as substrates . Compound 2a is converted to the corresponding alkoxide by treatment with a strong base , for example NaH ; the alkoxide replaces the fluorine at position 1 of 3b , leading to Ib . The substitution reaction of the fluorine on the aromatic ring is a particular reaction which involves an ionic intermediate { Meisenheimer intermediate ) and which occurs , according to the state of the art , in N,N-dimethylacetamide and dimethylsulfoxide . When NaH is used as the base in DMSO , a temperature of 60-70<0>C must not be exceeded . In particular , according to EP 273 658 , compound Ib is obtained from 3b and 2a in N,N-dimethylacetamide , by treatment of 2 with sodium hydride , at a temperature of 70<0>C , to produce the alkoxide , followed by addition of 1-fluoronaphthalene 3b in equimolecular amount , heating at 110<0>C for 60 min . The desired product Ib is recovered as crystalline oxalate in 76 % yield . Disclosure of the invention It has now been found that the synthesis of duloxetine , in particular of its precursor Ib , can be carried out more conveniently from compounds 2 and 3b , if l,3-dimethyl-2-oxo-hexahydropyrimidine ( DMPU) is used as the solvent instead of dimethylacetamide . Accordingly , the invention relates to a process for the preparation of duloxetine Ia : [0021] EMI4.1 1a which comprises the reaction between 1-fluoronaphthalene 3b EMI5.1 3b and 3-N,N-dimethylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-propan-l-ol 2a [0024] EMI5.2 to give ( CK)-(S) - N,N-dimethyl-[gamma]-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-2- thiophenepropanamine ) Ib : [0025 ] EMI5.3 1b and the conversion of Ib to duloxetine Ia , characterized in that the reaction between 2a and 3b is carried out in 1,3- dimethyl-2-oxo-hexahydropyrimidine ( DMPU) as the solvent . Typically , the reaction takes place at a temperature ranging from 70 to 120<0>C , for a time ranging from 45 min . to 8 hours . Comparative experiments for the synthesis of Ib from 1-fluoronaphthalene 3b and 3-N,N-dimethylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-propan-l-ol 2a , carried out using DMPU and dimethylacetamide as solvents , proved that DMPU is economically more advantageous than dimethylacetamide , as it requires lower reaction temperatures , shorter reaction times and provides higher yields . Typically , compound Ib is recovered as the oxalate , which is subsequently hydrolysed and subjected to fractional crystallization with tartaric acid ; compound Ib is recovered again by hydrolysis and each enantiomer is demethylated to give duloxetine Ia . Duloxetine enantiomers are also separated by fractional crystallization of the respective oxalates , hydrolysis of the salts , conversion to hydrochloride and recrystallization from ethanol . The invention is illustrated in greater detail in the following experimental section . Experimental section 1 . Comparative experiments - Synthesis of ( +)-(S)-N,N-dimethyl- [gamma]-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine ) Ib either in dimethylacetamide or DMPU Sodium hydride was suspended in either dimethylacetamide or DMPU in a slight molar excess with respect to alcohol 2a , which was added under stirring and nitrogen atmosphere . The mixture was heated to 70<0>C for 30 min. , thereafter 1-fluoronaphthalene 3b was slowly added , keeping again under stirring and nitrogen atmosphere , then the temperature was raised and maintained at 80 or 100<0>C for the required time . After that , the mixture was cooled to room temperature , added with a few ml of ethanol to destroy any excess of NaH and poured in 2 volumes of ice , followed by three extractions with 2 volumes of ethyl ether . The ether phase was washed three times with 1 volume of water and once with a saturated NaCl solution . After drying over sodium sulfate , the solvent was evaporated off and the oily residue was taken up in three volumes of methanol and added in the cold with 1.3 molar equiv. of oxalic acid in methanol . The resulting mixture was evaporated to dryness and the solid residue was crystallized from either hot methanol or ethyl acetate/methanol . The crystalline oxalate recovered by filtration was dried and weighed . Ib Oxalate : <1>H NMR ( DMSO - d6 ) [delta ] ( 8.27 ( IH , m ) , 7.85 ( IH , m ) , 7.53 ( 2H , m ) , 7.44 ( 2H , m ) , 7.33 ( IH , t , J = 7.9 Hz ) , 7.25 ( IH , d , J = 3.4 Hz ) , 7.04 ( IH , d , J = 7.7 Hz ) , 6.99 ( IH , dd , J = 3.5 , 5.0 Hz ) , 6.02 ( IH , dd , J = 4.9 , 7.7 Hz ) , 3.25 ( IH , m ) , 3.15 ( IH , m ) , 2.70 ( 6H , s ) , 2.58 ( IH , m ) , 2.39 ( IH , m ) . The experiments were followed over time through GC/MS analysis of sample aliquots and the yield was determined on the weight of Ib oxalate recovered in crystalline pure form after completion of the reaction . In particular , we calculated the yields in Ib resulting from the addition of 1.05 mol equiv. of 1-fluoronaphthalene 3b to 2a sodium salt , that had been obtained with 1.1 mols equiv. of NaH (60 % suspension in oil ) in DMPU and dimethylacetamide respectively at 70<0>C for 30 min . The results are reported hereinbelow . 1 ) At 100<0>C and with 2 % of 2a in DMPU , 2a completely disappeared after 50 min . and Ib as crystalline oxalate was obtained in 84 % yield , whereas in dimethylacetamide after the same time 13 % of 2a remained unreacted and the reaction terminated with complete disappearance of 2a ( which is the limiting substrate ) after 180 min . 2 ) At 100<0>C and with 10 % of 2a in DMPU , 3 % of 2a remained unreacted after 50 min. , whereas in dimethylacetamide the percentage of unreacted 2a was 14 % . The reaction was complete in DMPU after 90 min . and in dimethylacetamide after 300 min . ( 2a concentration lower than 1 % ) . 3 ) At 8O<0>C and with 2 % of 2a in DMPU 2a completely disappeared after 50 min . and oxalate Ib was obtained in 85 % yield , whereas in dimethylacetamide 4 % of 2a was still unreacted after 300 min. . If the reaction is interrupted at this time , the resulting oxalate Ib is contaminated by 2a . The separation of oxalates 2a and Ib through fractional crystallization is difficult and involves remarkable losses . In the present case , the reaction crude from this experiment led to oxalate Ib with a content in 2a lower than 0.5 % after 3 crystallizations from ethyl acetate/methanol and with a final yield of 48 % . It is therefore of the utmost importance that upon completion of the reaction Ib is free from 2a , because the purification of the oxalates by fractional crystallization involves a remarkable decrease in yields . 2. Syhthesis of ( + ) and (-)-duIoxetine Ia ( + ) And (-)-duloxetine Ia were obtained from racemic oxalate Ib according to a known method , hydrolysing Ib base from the oxalate by treatment with an excess of aqueous NaOH and extraction of the free base with ethyl ether . The free base was combined respectively with a non-natural and natural form of tartaric acid to give , after three crystallizations of the crystalline salt from absolute ethanol , the salts of ( + ) and (-) Ia . The free bases were recovered by treatment with an excess of aqueous base and extraction with an ether solvent . N-demethylation of ( + ) and (-) Ib was carried out by treatment with phenyl chloroformate in toluene under reflux and subsequent basic hydrolysis in a high-boiling solvent . ( + ) And (-)-duloxetine Ia were purified by crystallization of the corresponding oxalates and the free bases obtained as described above were converted to hydrochlorides by treatment with gaseous HCl in ethanol . The solutions were evaporated to dryness and the residue was crystallized from boiling ethanol . The enantiomeric excess of the products , determined by HPLC on a Chiracel OD column ( hexane/isopropanol/triethylamine ) was higher than 99.9 % .

[0001] 3-AMINOINDOLE COMPOUNDS AS CRTH2 RECEPTOR LIGANDS Field of the Invention This invention relates to a class of 3-aminoindole compounds which are ligands of the CRTH2 receptor ( Chemoattractant Receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T Helper cells type 2 ) , and their use in the treatment of diseases responsive to modulation of CRTH2 receptor activity , principally diseases having a significant inflammatory component . The invention also relates to novel members of that class of ligands and pharmaceutical compositions containing them . Background of the Invention Mast cells are known to play an important role in allergic and immune responses through the release of a number of mediators , such as histamine , leukotrienes , cytokines , prostaglandin D2 , etc ( Boyce ; Allergy Asthma Proc , 2004 , 25 , 27-30 ) . Prostaglandin D2 ( PGD2 ) is the major cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachadonic acid produced by mast cells in response to allergen challenge ( Lewis et al ; J. Immunol. , 1982 , 129 , 1627-1631 ) . It has been shown that PGD2 production is increased in patients with systemic mastocytosis ( Roberts ; N. Engl . J. Med . , 1980 , 303 , 1400-1404 ) , allergic rhinitis ( Naclerio et al ; Am . Rev. Respir . Dis. , 1983 , 128 , 597-602 ; Brown et al ; Arch . Otolarynol . Head Neck Surg. , 1987 , 113 , 179-183 ; Lebel et al ; J. Allergy Clin . Immunol. , 1988 , 82 , 869-877 ) , bronchial asthma ( Murray et al ; N. Engl . J. Med . , 1986 , 315 , 800-804 ; Liu et al ; Am . Rev. Respir . Dis. , 1990 , 142 , 126-132 ; Wenzel et al ; J. Allergy Clin . Immunol. , 1991 , 87 , 540-548 ) , ) , allergic conjunctivitis ( Proud et al ; J Allergy Clin Immunol . 1990 May ;85(5 ) :896-905 ) and urticaria ( Heavey et al ; J. Allergy Clin . Immunol. , 1986 , 78 , 458-461 ) . PGD2 mediates it effects through two receptors , the PGD2 ( or DP ) receptor ( Boie et al ; J. Biol . Chem. , 1995 , 270 , 18910-18916 ) and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 ( or CRTH2 ) ( Nagata et al ; J. Immunol. , 1999 , 162 , 1278-1289 ; Powell ; Prostaglandins Luekot . Essent . Fatty Acids , 2003 , 69 , 179-185 ) . Therefore , it has been postulated that agents that antagonise the effects of PGD2 at its receptors may have beneficial effects in a number of disease states . The CRTH2 receptor has been shown to be expressed on cell types associated with allergic inflammation , such as basophils , eosinophils , and Th2-type immune helper cells ( Hirai et al ; J. Exp . Med . , 2001 , 193 , 255-261 ) . The CRTH2 receptor has been shown to mediate PGD2-mediated cell migration in these cell types ( Hirai et al ; J. Exp . Med . , 2001 , 193 , 255-261 ) , and also to play a major role in neutrophil and eosinophil cell recruitment in a model of contact dermatitis ( Takeshita et al ; Int . Immunol. , 2004 , 16 , 947-959 ) . In addition , PGD2 has been shown to activate human eosinophils and Th2 cells ( Gazi et al ; Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat . 2005 Jan;75(1-4) :153-67 ) . Ramatroban {(3R)-3-[(4-fluorophenyl )sulfonyl- amino]-1 ,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9H-carbazole-9-propanoic acid} , a dual CRTH2 and thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist , has been shown to attenuate these responses ( Sugimoto et al ; J. Pharmacol . Exp . Ther. , 2003 , 305 , 347-352 ; Takeshita et al ; op . 5 cit ) . The potential of PGD2 both to enhance allergic inflammation and induce an inflammatory response has been demonstrated in mice and rats . Transgenic mice over expressing PGD2 synthase exhibit an enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia and increased levels of Th2 cytokines in response to allergen challenge ( Fujitani et al , J. Immunol. , 2002 , 168 , 443-449 ) . In addition , exogenously administered CRTH2 10 agonists enhance the allergic response in sensitised mice ( Spik et al ; J. Immunol. , 2005 , 174 , 3703-3708 ) . In rats exogenously applied CRTH2 agonists cause a pulmonary eosinophilia but a DP agonist ( BW 245C ) or a TP agonist (l-BOP) showed no effect ( Shirashi et al ; J. Pharmacol . Exp .

[0001] INHIBITION OF POLYMERISATION Field of the Invention This invention relates to the inhibition of premature polymerisation of monomers , in particular ethylenically unsaturated monomers . Background to the Invention Many of the industrially important ethylenically unsaturated monomers are highly susceptible to unwanted radical polymerisation . Examples of these monomers include styrene , [alpha]-methylstyrene , styrene sulphonic acid , vinyltoluene , divinylbenzenes and dienes such as butadiene or isoprene . Premature polymerisation may occur during manufacture , purification or storage of the monomer . Many of these monomers are purified by distillation . It is in this operation where premature polymerisation is most likely to occur and is the most troublesome . Methods to prevent or reduce the amount of such polymerisations are essential to prevent a dangerous runaway reaction , which can decrease cost-effectiveness of the process and be potentially explosive in nature . Stable nitroxides are known to inhibit the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers . Many of these nitroxides are based on 2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1 -oxide ( "TEMPO" ) , a particular example being 4-hydroxy-2 , 2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1 -oxide ( "4-hydroxy-TEMPO" ) , i .e . [0006 ] EMI2.1 US 5932735 and US 6080864 describe various TEMPO derivatives which are stated to be useful in inhibiting the premature polymerisation of unsaturated acids , esters , amides , nitriles and ethers ; vinyl pyridine , diethyl vinylphosphonate and sodium styrenesulfonate . Examples of the nitroxide compounds taught in this publication include 4-allyloxy- TEMPO and 4-(2-methoxyethoxy)-TEMPO . US 6403850 discloses nitroxide derivatives , including 4-carbomethoxy-TEMPO , A- carboethoxy-TEMPO and 4-ethanoyloxy-TEMPO , as being useful as inhibitors of premature polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers . EP-A-0574666 describes the synthesis of various 4-alkoxy-TEMPO compounds . In particular , this publication teaches the compounds 4-methoxy-TEMPO , 4-ethoxy-TEMPO and 4-n-butoxy-TEMPO . US 5631366 teaches that 4-alkoxy-TEMPO derivatives can be used as catalysts in the synthesis of 3-formylcephem derivatives . Specifically disclosed are 4-methoxy-TEMPO , 4-butoxy-TEMPO and 4-hexoxy-TEMPO . JP-A-5320217 teaches that 4-alkoxy-TEMPO compounds are useful in preventing polymerisation of methacrylic acid monomers when used in combination with phenothiazines , aromatic amines of phenolic compounds . Specifically disclosed are A- methoxy-TEMPO and 4-ethoxy-TEMPO . WO-A-98/56746 describes a composition for inhibiting the premature polymerisation of certain ethylenically unsaturated acrylate monomers . The composition comprises an ethylenically unsaturated acrylate monomer and a synergistic mixture of two nitroxide compounds . This publication describes a range of nitroxide compounds , including A- hydroxy-TEMPO , 4-propoxy-TEMPO , 4-(2-methoxyethoxyacetoxy)-TEMPO . The purification of ethylenically unsaturated monomers usually involves the partition of the monomers into organic and aqueous phases . Often , when a stable nitroxide inhibitor is used , the inhibitor only partitions sufficiently well into only one of the phases . Compounds such as 4-hydroxy-TEMPO have good water solubility but are generally poorly soluble in non-polar organic solvents . As a result , premature polymerisation is only effectively inhibited in the aqueous phase , not the organic phase . There remains a need for compounds and compositions which allow for effective inhibition of polymerisation in both the aqueous and organic phases . Summary of the Invention The present invention is based in part on the discovery that , by using hydrocarbyloxy substituents at the 4-position , the miscibility of TEMPO in organic solvents may be significantly increased . Such derivatives may be effective at inhibiting the premature polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers , especially when used in combination with a more hydrophilic nitroxide compound such as 4-hydroxy-TEMPO . According to a first aspect of the invention , a method of inhibiting polymerisation of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer comprises contacting the monomer with a compound of formula ( I ) : [0017] EMI4.1 ( I ) wherein R<1> is C4-20 hydrocarbyl ; and R [iota]2 , R r>3 , O R4 and R are independently each Ci-6 alkyl . A second aspect of the invention is a composition for inhibiting polymerisation of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer , which comprises first and second inhibitors of said polymerisation , wherein the first inhibitor is a first nitroxide compound and is of the formula ( I ) , and the second inhibitor is , for example but not limited thereto , a second nitroxide compound . Another aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of formula ( I ) as an inhibitor of polymerisation of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer . Another aspect of the invention is the use of a composition of the invention , as an inhibitor of polymerisation of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer . The present invention is particularly useful in inhibiting the polymerisation of monomers such as styrenes , vinyltoluenes , divinylbenzenes , dienes ( e .g . butadiene or isoprene ) , acrylonitrile and esters ( e .g . butyl acrylate , 2-ethylhexyl acrylate or vinyl acetate ) . Of particular mention are hydrocarbon monomers . Compounds of the present invention , particularly those wherein R<1> is C4-6 hydrocarbyl , may be prepared in liquid form and thus may be easier and more environmentally acceptable compared with conventional solid inhibitors . Furthermore , the compounds may improve the solubility of monomers and/or other inhibitors in organic solvents .

The ethylenically unsaturated monomer may be , for example , a hydrocarbon monomer such as a styrene ( e .g . styrene or [alpha]-methylstyrene ) , acrylonitrile , vinyltoluene , a divinylbenzene or a diene ( e .g . butadiene or isoprene ) . Other monomers include esters ( e .g . vinyl acetate , butyl acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate ) . In a particular embodiment , the monomer is a styrene ( e .g . styrene ) or acrylonitrile . The monomer may be present in a mixture with one or more comonomers . A composition of the invention may comprise an ethylenically unsaturated monomer , in particular a hydrocarbon monomer . Again , the ethylenically unsaturated monomer may be a styrene ( e .g . styrene , styrene sulphonic acid or [alpha]-methylstyrene ) , acrylonitrile , vinyltoluene , a divinylbenzene , a diene ( e .g . butadiene or isoprene ) , or an ester ( e .g . vinyl acetate , butyl acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate ) .

A composition of the invention may comprise a solvent , e.g . an organic solvent . Of particular mention are non-polar organic solvents , e.g . ethylbenzene . The amount of the or each nitroxide compound present may be varied according to the conditions and the type of monomer present . For the purposes of illustration , the or each compound may be present in amount of from about 1 to about 1000 ppm ( relative to the amount of monomer ) , more preferably from about 5 to about 500 ppm , more preferably still from about 10 to about 100 ppm .

The inhibitor or inhibitor composition may be brought into contact with monomer by any conventional method . It may be added as a concentrate solution in suitable solvents just upstream of the point of desired application by any suitable means . In addition , these compounds may be injected separately into the extraction or distillation train along with the incoming feed , or through separate entry points providing efficient distribution of the inhibitor composition . Since the inhibitor is gradually depleted during operation , it is generally necessary to maintain the appropriate amount of the inhibitor in the extraction or distillation apparatus by adding inhibitor during the course of the extraction or distillation process . Such addition may be carried out either on a generally continuous basis or it may consist of intermittently charging inhibitor into the extraction or distillation system if the concentration of inhibitor is to be maintained above the minimum required level . Processes for obtaining the nitroxide compounds of the invention are well known in the art and will be apparent to the skilled person ; see , for example , the teachings of EP-A- 0574666 , US 5631366 , JP-A-5320217 and WO-A-98/56746 . By way of example , the compounds may be obtained by reacting R<1>Br with 4-hydroxy-TEMPO in a nucleophilic substitution reaction , conducted in the presence of , for example , aqueous sodium hydroxide , toluene and Bu4NBr . The following Examples illustrate the invention . Example 1 The solubilities of 4-oxo-TEMPO , 4-hydroxy-TEMPO and 4-butoxy-TEMPO in water and toluene were tested by preparing saturated solutions and measuring the amounts dissolved . The solubilities of the compounds are given in Table 1 . 4-butoxy-TEMPO was found to have a greater solubility in toluene than the 4-oxo- and 4-hydroxy-TEMPO compounds . [0076] EMI12.1 Table 1 Example 2 The evaluation of the efficacy of a selection of nitroxide compounds of the invention was carried out using a continuous stirred tank reactor ( CSTR ) which mimicked the re-boiler of a styrene distillation column . The styrene had a residence time of approximately 2 hours inside the reactor and , at 110<0>C , the CSTR dead volume was 180 ml . A steady state was reached in four hours using a styrene flow rate of 90 ml/hr . Data gathered after this point was averaged to give the steady state polymer level . Nitrogen sparging to remove oxygen gas was carried out at a measured rate of 200 ml/minute . Apart from the inhibitors , the only variable was the inherent variation in the rate of thermal initiation of styrene polymerisation . The nitroxides tested were 4-methoxy-TEMPO , 4-hydroxy- TEMPO , TEMPO , 4-butoxy-TEMPO and 4-allyloxy-TEMPO . The steady state polymer levels for each compound are given in Table 2. Taking into account differences in molecular weight ( for example , the molecular weights of 4- hydroxy-TEMPO and 4-butoxy-TEMPO are 172 and 228 respectively , giving about 25 % less 4-butoxy-TEMPO than 4-hydroxy-TEMPO at a fixed ppm level ) , the inhibitory activity of 4-butoxy-TEMPO is comparable to the inhibitory activities of 4-methoxy-TEMPO and 4-hydroxy-TEMPO . [0081] EMI13.1 Table 2 Example 3 The experiment of Example 2 was repeated using combinations of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO and the other compounds . The steady state polymer levels for each combination are given in Table 3. It is evident that the combination of 4-butoxy-TEMPO and 4-hydroxy-TEMPO was a more effective inhibitor than any of the other combinations . In addition , this combination was considerably more effective than the individual compounds as tested in Example 2. [0086 ] EMI13.2 Table 3 Example 4 The efficacy of various inhibitors was evaluated with respect to the monomers vinyl acetate , acrylonitrile , 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and isoprene . The efficacy of each inhibitor was determined by heating in pure monomer or a solution of monomer in a suitable solvent( s ) for a set time and at a known temperature . The storage inhibitor was removed from each monomer by distillation or treatment with neutral silica . In each of the tables below , the amount of polymer generated is expressed as % w/w of the monomer . Vinyl acetate monomer In this case , the tubes and solution were degassed with nitrogen prior to sealing and heating at 16O<0>C for 48 hours . As the table below illustrates , 4-butoxy-TEMPO was found to be a more effective inhibitor than phenothiazine . Synergy was observed with a combination of 4- butoxytempo and phenothiazine . [0092 ] EMI14.1 Acrylonitrile monomer Similarly , tubes containing acrylonitrile and various inhibitors were heated at 120<0>C for 7 days . The air was not removed from these solutions prior to heating . As the table below illustrates , 4-butoxy-TEMPO was found to be a more effective inhibitor than 4-hydroxy-TEMPO . EMI15.1 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate monomer Similarly , tubes containing 5 ppm inhibitor in 2-ethylhexyl acrylate were heated at 145<0>C and the results expressed as inhibition time ( i .e . the time to appearance of insoluble polymer ) . Data were generated in nitrogen and in the presence of air . As the table below illustrates , 4-butoxy-TEMPO was found to be an effective inhibitor of polymerisation . [0098] EMI15.2 lsoprene monomer Similarly tubes containing 100 ppm inhibitor in a solution of lsoprene in dimethylformamide containing 1 or 3 % furfural were heated at 160 <0>C for 1hr . As the table below illustrates , 4-butoxy-TEMPO was found to be an effective inhibitor of polymerisation . The results are expressed as ppm insoluble polymer . [0101] EMI15.3 Example 5 Saturated solutions of the inhibitors/retarders phenothiazine and 4-methoxyphenol were prepared in 4-butoxy-TEMPO . These saturated solutions were then added to styrene so that the concentration of each inhibitor/retarder was above the solubility limit for that material in styrene alone . The solutions were observed for physical stability at 20<0>C. The table below shows the soluble amount of each inhibitor/retarder in 4-butoxy-TEMPO plus styrene : [0104 ] EMI16.1 The same inhibitors were then added to styrene monomer at various concentrations in the absence of 4-butoxy-TEMPO , to determine if solubility was enhanced by including 4- butoxyTEMPO in the formulation . The table below shows the solubility of the inhibitors/retarders in styrene in the absence of 4-butoxy-TEMPO : [0106 ] EMI16.2 Comparing the two sets of experiments , it was apparent that the presence of 4-butoxy- TEMPO enhanced the solubility of the other inhibitors . Example 6 The solubility of 4-hydroxytempo in ethylbenzene is only 8.1 % wt/wt at 20<0>C. A solution of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO and 4-butoxy-TEMPO in ethylbenzene was prepared with a 4- hydroxy-TEMPO concentration of 14.9 % with respect to ethylbenzene . This gave a clear red solution , indicating that the presence of 4-butoxy-TEMPO enhanced the solubility of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO in ethylbenzene . CLAIMS 1 .
